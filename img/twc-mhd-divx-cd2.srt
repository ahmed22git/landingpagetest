1
00:00:02,292 --> 00:00:05,590
- Before what?
- Before...

2
00:00:05,806 --> 00:00:10,397
...I kill you.
- Then they'd put you in jail.

3
00:00:14,018 --> 00:00:17,422
Then I cry, cry, cry,
and then I say with big emotion...

4
00:00:17,636 --> 00:00:20,626
"I hate you! I hate us both!"

5
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:27,404
- Such a lame scene.
- But you are really good.

6
00:00:28,597 --> 00:00:30,850
Thank you, darling.

7
00:00:45,642 --> 00:00:48,275
Hi, there. Who are you?

8
00:00:51,453 --> 00:00:53,291
Betty?

9
00:01:00,116 --> 00:01:03,105
Betty, can I see you outside
for a minute?

10
00:01:17,235 --> 00:01:19,073
What is it, Coco?

11
00:01:19,322 --> 00:01:20,781
Your aunt called.

12
00:01:22,314 --> 00:01:23,808
I was afraid of that.

13
00:01:24,019 --> 00:01:26,901
She wants to know who's
staying in her apartment.

14
00:01:27,847 --> 00:01:30,729
It 's just for a night or two.
Until she finds her own place.

15
00:01:30,943 --> 00:01:33,303
I tried to explain that to aunt Ruth
but the connection was bad...

16
00:01:33,517 --> 00:01:36,613
and her plane was leaving,
and she got it all mixed up.

17
00:01:36,823 --> 00:01:38,661
I kept telling her
that it was my friend Rita...

18
00:01:38,876 --> 00:01:41,165
and she kept saying
she didn't know any Ritas.

19
00:01:42,424 --> 00:01:46,493
- Look at me straight, sweetie.
- Coco, she's very nice.

20
00:01:46,704 --> 00:01:48,507
Honey, you're a good kid...

21
00:01:48,723 --> 00:01:51,878
but what you're telling me is
a load of horse puckey.

22
00:01:52,411 --> 00:01:54,807
Even though it
comes from a good place.

23
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,451
I'm gonna trust you
to sort this thing out.

24
00:01:58,221 --> 00:02:01,412
- Thank you.
- Don't make me out to be a sucker.

25
00:02:01,978 --> 00:02:05,584
Louise Bonner said there is trouble
in there, remember last night?

26
00:02:06,189 --> 00:02:09,795
Well, sometimes she's wrong...

27
00:02:10,016 --> 00:02:14,287
but if there is trouble,
get rid of it.

28
00:02:23,898 --> 00:02:25,950
Is everything all right?

29
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:31,367
- Is it bad for you that I'm here?
- No, no, everything is A-Okay.

30
00:02:31,587 --> 00:02:36,794
Now, I've gotta fix that sandwich.
And my audition is in one hour!

31
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:59,140
I hope I'm back
in a couple of hours.

32
00:02:59,561 --> 00:03:02,586
- And don't drink all the Coke.
- Good luck.

33
00:03:02,797 --> 00:03:06,687
When I get back, I'll keep the
cab waiting, so be ready to go.

34
00:03:36,999 --> 00:03:38,137
"Voilà!"

35
00:03:39,016 --> 00:03:41,863
Betty Elms, I would
like you to meet...

36
00:03:42,078 --> 00:03:44,260
Jack Tutman, my assistant.

37
00:03:45,349 --> 00:03:48,445
Woody Katz, who we have
cast in the part of Chuck...

38
00:03:48,655 --> 00:03:50,980
and will do the scene with you.

39
00:03:51,716 --> 00:03:53,792
Bob Rooker, our director...

40
00:03:54,012 --> 00:03:56,029
and Julie Chadwick.

41
00:03:56,587 --> 00:04:00,620
Now, our surprise guest,
Lynne James.

42
00:04:00,832 --> 00:04:03,892
Alas, we can't afford her to
cast our show but...

43
00:04:04,102 --> 00:04:08,266
well, as casting agents go,
she is the best.

44
00:04:08,834 --> 00:04:11,954
Why, thank you, Wally.
Hello, Betty.

45
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:16,202
- Very pleased to meet you.
- This is my assistant, Nikki.

46
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:22,431
And the ever lovely Martha. Martha
Johnson, whom you met out front.

47
00:04:24,805 --> 00:04:26,085
Hi.

48
00:04:26,753 --> 00:04:30,394
So, shall we give it a go?

49
00:04:31,172 --> 00:04:34,920
Would you like a water,
a coffee before we begin?

50
00:04:35,137 --> 00:04:37,011
No, I'm fine.

51
00:04:37,225 --> 00:04:40,215
Well then,
let 's everyone take a seat.

52
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:49,400
Betty, why don't you join Woody
over there and we'll play the scene.

53
00:04:49,612 --> 00:04:52,601
Bob, do you have anything
you wish to say?

54
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:55,967
Something to Betty
before we begin?

55
00:04:56,187 --> 00:04:58,690
No. It 's not a contest.

56
00:05:00,015 --> 00:05:01,783
The two of them...

57
00:05:02,694 --> 00:05:05,232
with themselves.

58
00:05:05,895 --> 00:05:09,609
So don't play it for real...

59
00:05:09,827 --> 00:05:12,744
until it gets real.

60
00:05:17,794 --> 00:05:19,526
Okay.

61
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,414
Just tell me where it hurts, baby.

62
00:05:22,631 --> 00:05:23,698
What?

63
00:05:23,918 --> 00:05:27,596
I wanna play this one nice and close
like we did with that other girl...

64
00:05:27,954 --> 00:05:31,394
what 's her name? With the black
hair. It felt good, what do you think?

65
00:05:31,608 --> 00:05:35,771
That 's good, Woody. Just don't rush
that line again. I told you...

66
00:05:35,991 --> 00:05:38,767
the line where you say:
"Before what?"

67
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:45,658
Bobby, acting is reacting.
I just play off them. They all say:

68
00:05:46,359 --> 00:05:49,349
"They're gonna arrest you", like
that, and: "They'll put you in jail."

69
00:05:49,561 --> 00:05:52,930
They say it the same way.
So when they say it, I just react.

70
00:05:53,145 --> 00:05:54,460
- What 's your name?
- Betty.

71
00:05:54,675 --> 00:05:59,717
Betty, look. You don't rush it,
I don't rush it, okay?

72
00:05:59,929 --> 00:06:05,659
Now, we're gonna play this nice and
close just like in the movies, okay?

73
00:06:08,419 --> 00:06:11,265
Dad's best friend goes to work.

74
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:13,949
Bob?

75
00:06:16,281 --> 00:06:17,811
And...

76
00:06:18,613 --> 00:06:20,345
action!

77
00:06:24,284 --> 00:06:26,229
You're still here.

78
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:29,256
I came back.

79
00:06:29,712 --> 00:06:32,973
- I thought that 's what you wanted.
- Nobody wants you here.

80
00:06:33,191 --> 00:06:34,686
Really?

81
00:06:34,896 --> 00:06:39,001
My parents are right upstairs.
They think you've left.

82
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:40,942
So, surprise!

83
00:06:41,542 --> 00:06:46,548
- I can call them, I can call my dad.
- But you won't.

84
00:07:02,591 --> 00:07:05,580
You're playing a dangerous
game here.

85
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:09,609
If you're trying to blackmail me...

86
00:07:10,071 --> 00:07:12,503
it 's not gonna work.

87
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:18,347
You know what I want.
It 's not that difficult.

88
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:23,078
Get out.

89
00:07:25,033 --> 00:07:27,666
Get out before I call my dad.

90
00:07:28,547 --> 00:07:32,058
He trusts you. You're his...

91
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:35,052
best friend.

92
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:41,762
This will be the end
of everything.

93
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:47,848
What about you? What'll
your dad think about you?

94
00:07:48,449 --> 00:07:50,394
Stop.

95
00:07:50,884 --> 00:07:52,900
Stop it.

96
00:07:54,363 --> 00:07:57,175
That 's what you said from
the beginning.

97
00:07:58,573 --> 00:08:02,915
If I tell them what happened, they
will arrest you and put you in jail.

98
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:12,202
So get out of here...

99
00:08:12,421 --> 00:08:14,224
before...

100
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,893
Before what?

101
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:39,942
Before...

102
00:08:40,569 --> 00:08:43,309
I kill you.

103
00:08:57,791 --> 00:09:00,673
Well, then they'd put you in jail.

104
00:09:09,204 --> 00:09:11,635
I hate you.

105
00:09:12,613 --> 00:09:14,796
I hate us both.

106
00:09:30,949 --> 00:09:33,345
- I'm gonna take her over there.
- Yeah, big time.

107
00:09:37,386 --> 00:09:39,853
Well, there it was.

108
00:09:40,517 --> 00:09:45,417
Yeah, there it was, all right. Baby,
you got a way with you. Really.

109
00:09:46,362 --> 00:09:47,572
Bob?

110
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:51,988
Very good. Really.

111
00:09:52,556 --> 00:09:58,571
I mean, it was forced maybe,
but still humanistic.

112
00:10:00,801 --> 00:10:03,375
Very good. Really!

113
00:10:03,898 --> 00:10:05,665
Really.

114
00:10:11,066 --> 00:10:16,238
Oh, I thank you, Betty.
And I really mean that, sincerely.

115
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:18,083
I mean, it was...

116
00:10:18,303 --> 00:10:20,212
extraordinary.

117
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:22,577
You've done your aunt proud today.

118
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:26,539
I'm going to tell
her that first chance I get.

119
00:10:26,757 --> 00:10:31,099
Now, you and I are going
to speak again very soon.

120
00:10:31,768 --> 00:10:35,066
- Thank you, Mr. Brown.
- Thank you, Wally.

121
00:10:35,282 --> 00:10:39,066
I'm sure you all have a lot to talk
about. We'll walk Betty out.

122
00:10:39,283 --> 00:10:42,723
Yes, indeed.
And it was our pleasure, Lynne.

123
00:10:42,937 --> 00:10:47,349
Don't you be a stranger around here.
We'd love to have you here.

124
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:50,374
- Come on, Betty.
- Thank you again, Mr. Brown.

125
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:53,817
And it was nice meeting
all of you.

126
00:10:54,383 --> 00:10:55,592
Bye.

127
00:10:57,236 --> 00:10:58,860
Bye!

128
00:11:03,324 --> 00:11:06,242
She's a slam-dunk! Where
the hell did you find her?

129
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:08,950
God, that was awful!

130
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:14,313
Not you, Betty. You were stellar,
and I mean that. But poor Wally.

131
00:11:14,528 --> 00:11:18,834
He'll never get that picture made.
Wally's days were up 2O years ago.

132
00:11:19,051 --> 00:11:22,147
You know Woody Katz
is only doing it for a favor.

133
00:11:22,391 --> 00:11:24,408
And the cast they have
so far is terrible.

134
00:11:24,618 --> 00:11:29,102
Oh, God, terrible!
That poor old fool Wally.

135
00:11:29,315 --> 00:11:32,921
He was very nice
and he seems so sweet.

136
00:11:33,143 --> 00:11:35,776
And Wally... Mr. Brown is a very
close friend of my aunt 's.

137
00:11:35,996 --> 00:11:39,092
Don't get me wrong, I love Wally.

138
00:11:39,301 --> 00:11:42,326
I ought to, I was married
to him for 1O years.

139
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:48,440
And I love actors. All actors.
We just get a little catty sometimes.

140
00:11:49,251 --> 00:11:52,027
We want to take you across and
introduce you to a director...

141
00:11:52,244 --> 00:11:53,976
who's a head above the rest.

142
00:11:54,192 --> 00:11:56,517
He's got a project
you will kill for.

143
00:11:56,872 --> 00:11:59,541
Knock right out of the park!

144
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:04,101

Why I love you

172
00:13:52,629 --> 00:13:57,315
- Cut it! Thank you very much, Carol.
- Checking the gate?

173
00:13:57,534 --> 00:14:00,072
Checking the gate! Thank you.
We'll tell you what happens next!

174
00:14:00,769 --> 00:14:03,367
Thank you very much for coming in.
I know how busy you are.

175
00:14:03,588 --> 00:14:06,470
Are you kidding me? I loved the script.
Just show me where to sign.

176
00:14:06,685 --> 00:14:09,639
I love you, but there's no way they're
gonna let me cast this thing...

177
00:14:09,851 --> 00:14:12,211
until I've seen everyone. I'll let
you know as soon as I can.

178
00:14:12,425 --> 00:14:17,147
I know you will. Because my manager
is gonna be bugging you. And me!

179
00:14:17,366 --> 00:14:20,426
- My pleasure. Now get outta here.
- You're so cruel to me.

180
00:14:20,637 --> 00:14:23,448
- I'm the girl who's playing this part.
- I'll see you later.

181
00:14:25,382 --> 00:14:27,185
Hank? Where's Hank?

182
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:30,146
- Who's next, Hank?
- Camilla Rhodes.

183
00:14:31,505 --> 00:14:33,902
- Is she ready?
- All ready.

184
00:14:34,811 --> 00:14:37,693
- Bring her in.
- Camilla Rhodes, next.

185
00:14:43,962 --> 00:14:47,568
"Sylvia North Story".
Camilla Rhodes, take one.

186
00:14:48,172 --> 00:14:50,639
Okay, here we go.
Let 's lock it up, please.

187
00:14:51,373 --> 00:14:53,734
- Roll sound, please.
- That 's fit.

188
00:14:53,948 --> 00:14:55,821
Playback and action.

189
00:15:09,779 --> 00:15:12,139
Why haven't I told you?

190
00:15:12,492 --> 00:15:15,826
Oh, baby, I told

191
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:17,844
Every little star

192
00:15:18,059 --> 00:15:22,330
Just how sweet I think you are

193
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:26,818
Why haven't I told you?

194
00:15:27,523 --> 00:15:31,794
- Get Jason over here.
- Cindy, Adam wants to see Jason.

195
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:37,954
Made my heart an open book

196
00:15:38,622 --> 00:15:43,249
Why haven't I told you?

197
00:15:46,172 --> 00:15:49,920
Friends ask me
Am I in love

198
00:15:50,138 --> 00:15:53,993
I always answer yes"

199
00:15:54,209 --> 00:15:58,064
Might as well confess

200
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:01,826
If the answer's yes

201
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:06,209
Maybe you may love me too

202
00:16:06,422 --> 00:16:10,384
Oh, my darling, if you do

203
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:14,280
- Why haven't you told me?
- Did you want to tell something?

204
00:16:25,105 --> 00:16:27,216
This is the girl.

205
00:16:32,273 --> 00:16:34,811
Excellent choice, Adam.

206
00:16:46,225 --> 00:16:48,169
Oh, my goodness.

207
00:16:57,776 --> 00:16:59,793
I have to be somewhere.

208
00:17:00,003 --> 00:17:02,291
I promised a friend.

209
00:17:03,169 --> 00:17:06,775
- I'm sorry, I must go.
- Now?

210
00:17:31,178 --> 00:17:33,254
Should be around here.

211
00:17:34,135 --> 00:17:36,496
259O. That 's it.

212
00:17:36,884 --> 00:17:39,695
Up there!
Does it look familiar?

213
00:17:48,644 --> 00:17:51,146
- Don't stop!
- What is it? What do you see?

214
00:17:51,531 --> 00:17:54,936
- Those men, in front, in the car.
- Do you know them?

215
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:59,003
Keep going.
Go around to the back.

216
00:18:47,757 --> 00:18:50,498
Selwyn, number 12.

217
00:19:14,165 --> 00:19:16,561
Now you got me scared.

218
00:19:40,887 --> 00:19:42,274
You see?

219
00:19:42,487 --> 00:19:45,512
I told you there was nothing
to be afraid of.

220
00:20:47,341 --> 00:20:48,729
Betty, wait. Wait!

221
00:20:51,272 --> 00:20:52,767
Don't.

222
00:21:19,246 --> 00:21:21,713
No one's home.

223
00:21:21,926 --> 00:21:23,551
Yes?

224
00:21:24,918 --> 00:21:26,756
Diane?

225
00:21:28,502 --> 00:21:30,613
Number 17.

226
00:21:32,398 --> 00:21:34,936
But it said number 12.

227
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:38,693
I switched apartments with her.

228
00:21:38,904 --> 00:21:42,759
She's in 17.
It 's down at the end, on the left.

229
00:21:47,394 --> 00:21:50,312
But she hasn't been around
for a few days.

230
00:21:52,439 --> 00:21:54,728
We'll leave her a note.

231
00:21:54,944 --> 00:21:56,925
I'll go with you.

232
00:21:58,946 --> 00:22:01,413
She still got some of my stuff.

233
00:22:06,844 --> 00:22:09,761
You go ahead.
I gotta get that.

234
00:22:24,762 --> 00:22:28,404
- Guess you're not Diane Selwyn.
- Guess I'm not.

235
00:23:06,027 --> 00:23:08,767
There's still no one home, I guess.

236
00:23:38,175 --> 00:23:40,773
- What are you doing?
- Come on, help me in.

237
00:23:41,933 --> 00:23:44,566
Come on, I'll open the front door.

238
00:23:45,343 --> 00:23:46,932
No!

239
00:23:51,501 --> 00:23:53,233
Come on.

240
00:23:57,486 --> 00:23:59,395
Come on!

241
00:26:24,939 --> 00:26:27,715
I know what you're doing.

242
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:51,167
I know what you have to do.

243
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:56,141
But let me do it.

244
00:27:04,325 --> 00:27:07,207
Let me do it.

245
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:32,776
You look like someone else.

246
00:27:54,461 --> 00:27:56,371
Good night, Betty.

247
00:27:56,584 --> 00:27:59,360
You don't have to wear
that in the house.

248
00:27:59,716 --> 00:28:01,305
What?

249
00:28:01,525 --> 00:28:03,328
The wig!

250
00:28:03,543 --> 00:28:08,928
I was just looking at myself again.
I'll take it off to sleep.

251
00:28:09,597 --> 00:28:12,064
You don't have
to sleep on that couch.

252
00:28:12,276 --> 00:28:16,439
- No, it 's okay.
- No, it 's not. This is a huge bed.

253
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:18,875
Come on, just get in
and get a good night sleep.

254
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:54,404
It 's more comfortable than
the couch, isn't it?

255
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:05,777
Thank you, Betty.

256
00:29:06,483 --> 00:29:11,205
It 's nothing. I shouldn't have let
you sleep on the couch last night.

257
00:29:11,424 --> 00:29:13,227
No, I mean...

258
00:29:14,034 --> 00:29:16,216
thank you for everything.

259
00:29:20,471 --> 00:29:22,095
You're welcome.

260
00:29:32,265 --> 00:29:34,732
Good night, sweet Betty.

261
00:29:44,374 --> 00:29:46,485
Good night.

262
00:30:28,317 --> 00:30:30,987
Have you ever done this before?

263
00:30:32,422 --> 00:30:34,499
I don't know.

264
00:30:34,719 --> 00:30:36,308
Have you?

265
00:30:50,445 --> 00:30:53,363
I want to with you.

266
00:31:18,941 --> 00:31:21,966
I'm in love with you.

267
00:31:35,954 --> 00:31:38,944
I'm in love with you.

268
00:32:05,076 --> 00:32:07,887
Silence.

269
00:32:08,694 --> 00:32:11,055
Silence.

270
00:32:12,487 --> 00:32:15,025
Silence.

271
00:32:15,967 --> 00:32:18,636
There's no band.

272
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:22,218
There's no band.

273
00:32:23,099 --> 00:32:25,910
There's no orchestra.

274
00:32:27,448 --> 00:32:29,560
Silence!

275
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:47,801
- Rita?
- There's no band.

276
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:50,719
Rita, wake up!

277
00:32:54,621 --> 00:32:56,246
It 's okay. It 's okay.

278
00:32:56,466 --> 00:32:58,483
No, it 's not okay.

279
00:32:59,423 --> 00:33:01,784
What 's wrong?

280
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:05,225
Go with me somewhere.

281
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:10,100
It 's two o'clock. It 's two
o'clock in the morning.

282
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:16,783
Go with me somewhere.

283
00:33:16,994 --> 00:33:19,010
Sure.

284
00:33:19,221 --> 00:33:20,715
Now?

285
00:33:22,457 --> 00:33:24,401
Right now.

286
00:34:58,624 --> 00:35:01,649
There's no band!

287
00:35:02,521 --> 00:35:05,617
There is no band!

288
00:35:10,663 --> 00:35:12,572
This is all...

289
00:35:13,203 --> 00:35:15,599
a tape recording.

290
00:35:15,812 --> 00:35:18,766
There's no band, and yet...

291
00:35:19,604 --> 00:35:22,107
we hear a band.

292
00:35:22,632 --> 00:35:25,728
If we want to hear
a clarinet...

293
00:35:26,285 --> 00:35:28,159
listen...

294
00:35:41,838 --> 00:35:45,029
A muted trombone.

295
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:02,915
A muted trumpet.

296
00:36:20,527 --> 00:36:23,552
It 's all recorded.

297
00:36:25,956 --> 00:36:28,910
There's no band!

298
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:32,214
It is all...

299
00:36:32,810 --> 00:36:35,171
a tape.

300
00:36:47,597 --> 00:36:52,224
It is an illusion.

301
00:36:57,026 --> 00:36:58,864
Listen!

302
00:38:12,283 --> 00:38:18,369
Ladies and gentlemen,
let Club Silencio introduce to you...

303
00:38:18,824 --> 00:38:21,565
"La Llorona de Los Angeles".

304
00:38:21,781 --> 00:38:25,008
Rebekah del Rio.

305
00:38:44,641 --> 00:38:48,081
I was all right

306
00:38:48,294 --> 00:38:51,355
For a while

307
00:38:51,564 --> 00:38:58,066
I could smile for a while

308
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:01,684
But I saw you last night

309
00:39:01,898 --> 00:39:05,896
You held my hand so tight

310
00:39:06,108 --> 00:39:13,060
As you stopped to say hello

311
00:39:13,484 --> 00:39:18,111
You wished me well and you

312
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:21,582
Couldn't tell

313
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:27,495
That I've been crying

314
00:39:27,715 --> 00:39:30,704
Over you

315
00:39:30,916 --> 00:39:34,356
Crying

316
00:39:34,569 --> 00:39:37,166
Over you

317
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:43,573
Since you said so long"

318
00:39:44,137 --> 00:39:50,638
I've been miserable and alone

319
00:39:51,061 --> 00:39:54,916
Lonesome and crying

320
00:39:55,444 --> 00:39:58,399
Crying

321
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:02,154
Crying

322
00:40:02,368 --> 00:40:04,871
Crying

323
00:40:05,083 --> 00:40:11,785
It's hard to understand

324
00:40:12,006 --> 00:40:18,508
That upon seeing you again

325
00:40:18,722 --> 00:40:22,993
I'd be crying

326
00:40:23,731 --> 00:40:26,851
I thought

327
00:40:27,072 --> 00:40:30,168
That I was over you

328
00:40:30,377 --> 00:40:37,329
But it's true, so true

329
00:40:37,545 --> 00:40:41,020
I love you even more

330
00:40:41,233 --> 00:40:44,779
Much more than I did before

331
00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:50,863
But darling, what can I do

332
00:40:51,079 --> 00:40:56,916
You don't love me anymore

333
00:40:57,133 --> 00:41:04,085
And I will always be

334
00:41:04,649 --> 00:41:11,257
Crying over you

335
00:41:11,467 --> 00:41:17,553
Crying over you

336
00:41:17,765 --> 00:41:24,053
Your love has captured

337
00:41:24,271 --> 00:41:30,072
The whole of my heart

338
00:41:30,291 --> 00:41:34,040
That was left crying

339
00:41:34,258 --> 00:41:37,519
Crying

340
00:41:37,736 --> 00:41:40,892
Crying

341
00:41:41,112 --> 00:41:44,552
Crying

342
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:07,343
Betty?

343
00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:12,102
Betty?

344
00:43:24,183 --> 00:43:26,995
Where are you?

345
00:46:10,111 --> 00:46:11,950
Hey, pretty girl.

346
00:46:12,930 --> 00:46:14,874
Time to wake up.

347
00:47:51,986 --> 00:47:55,046
- Where have you been?
- What do you want?

348
00:47:55,709 --> 00:47:58,663
My lamp and dishes.

349
00:48:00,475 --> 00:48:03,393
Come on, Diane,
it 's been three weeks.

350
00:48:05,764 --> 00:48:08,860
I put your dishes in that box.

351
00:48:28,797 --> 00:48:32,438
- That 's my ashtray.
- Take it.

352
00:48:44,210 --> 00:48:48,552
- Anytime.
- I'm just making sure, Diane.

353
00:48:57,953 --> 00:49:00,100
This is it?

354
00:49:05,713 --> 00:49:09,259
By the way, those two detectives
came by again looking for you.

355
00:50:03,225 --> 00:50:05,337
Camilla!

356
00:50:07,922 --> 00:50:10,211
You've come back.

357
00:51:51,676 --> 00:51:54,665
What was that you were saying,
beautiful?

358
00:51:55,190 --> 00:51:56,957
I said...

359
00:51:57,416 --> 00:52:00,156
you drive me wild.

360
00:52:12,726 --> 00:52:15,157
We shouldn't do this anymore.

361
00:52:21,528 --> 00:52:23,888
Don't say that.

362
00:52:28,591 --> 00:52:31,509
Don't ever say that.

363
00:52:31,723 --> 00:52:33,632
Don't, Diane!

364
00:52:33,845 --> 00:52:35,303
Stop it!

365
00:52:35,515 --> 00:52:37,175
Diane, stop!

366
00:52:38,334 --> 00:52:41,039
I've tried to tell you this before.

367
00:52:49,537 --> 00:52:51,790
It 's him, isn't it?

368
00:53:03,385 --> 00:53:06,683
I'm not trying to show you how
to do the scene, but just...

369
00:53:07,943 --> 00:53:10,968
watch me and I think you'll
understand what I'm getting at.

370
00:53:15,492 --> 00:53:18,790
Don't sit so rigid, just...

371
00:53:19,006 --> 00:53:20,500
just relax.

372
00:53:21,372 --> 00:53:25,500
Now, the two of you are alone
and it 's real comfortable.

373
00:53:27,148 --> 00:53:29,781
Like you've known
each other forever.

374
00:53:30,001 --> 00:53:33,299
Even if you don't say anything,
it 's real comfortable.

375
00:53:35,011 --> 00:53:38,487
Hank, can you just clear the set?
There's too many people around here.

376
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:41,582
- Let 's get this worked out.
- Clear the set!

377
00:53:41,796 --> 00:53:44,393
Everyone have a cup of coffee.

378
00:53:45,449 --> 00:53:48,711
- Everyone, please!
- Can Diane stay?

379
00:53:48,928 --> 00:53:52,474
Yeah, sure, Diane can stay.
Hank, let Diane stay!

380
00:53:52,686 --> 00:53:54,489
Diane!

381
00:53:59,888 --> 00:54:03,257
Now, when she starts to cry,
don't pull her towards you.

382
00:54:05,386 --> 00:54:10,214
Let her fall into you.
Just let her fall.

383
00:54:14,189 --> 00:54:16,241
And when you kiss her...

384
00:54:17,807 --> 00:54:20,796
it 's just a continuation
of that move.

385
00:54:23,165 --> 00:54:25,276
There's no break.

386
00:54:50,199 --> 00:54:52,417
Kill the lights!

387
00:55:02,794 --> 00:55:05,570
Don't be mad.
Don't make it be like this.

388
00:55:05,786 --> 00:55:09,427
Oh, sure, you want me to make
this easy for you.

389
00:55:09,648 --> 00:55:12,495
No fucking way!
It 's not gonna be!

390
00:55:13,267 --> 00:55:15,805
- It 's not easy for me!
- Diane!

391
00:56:39,937 --> 00:56:43,199
Hello, it's me.
Leave a message.

392
00:56:45,921 --> 00:56:47,653
Diane?

393
00:56:52,184 --> 00:56:55,102
- Hello?
- Diane?

394
00:56:56,707 --> 00:56:58,130
Camilla.

395
00:56:58,343 --> 00:57:02,233
Diane, the car's waiting.
Are you okay?

396
00:57:03,179 --> 00:57:05,432
You coming?

397
00:57:10,903 --> 00:57:15,174
Good. It means so much to me.

398
00:57:15,913 --> 00:57:19,554
Go on. The car's right
outside your house.

399
00:57:19,984 --> 00:57:22,760
It's been waiting, okay?

400
00:57:27,046 --> 00:57:28,849
Okay.

401
00:57:29,064 --> 00:57:33,027
It's 698O, Mulholland Drive.

402
00:57:33,970 --> 00:57:36,153
Mulholland Drive.

403
00:58:45,575 --> 00:58:48,944
What are you doing?
We don't stop here.

404
00:58:53,821 --> 00:58:55,873
A surprise.

405
00:59:18,802 --> 00:59:20,641
Shortcut.

406
00:59:23,220 --> 00:59:25,723
Come on, sweetheart.

407
00:59:31,049 --> 00:59:32,994
It 's beautiful.

408
00:59:33,207 --> 00:59:35,532
A secret path.

409
01:00:43,245 --> 01:00:45,428
Perfect timing.

410
01:00:46,133 --> 01:00:48,280
Welcome, Diane.

411
01:00:53,892 --> 01:00:57,438
Well...
Here's to love.

412
01:01:07,982 --> 01:01:10,829
Here's to love.

413
01:01:15,603 --> 01:01:17,750
Here she is!

414
01:01:26,319 --> 01:01:29,166
I don't believe
you met my mother.

415
01:01:29,868 --> 01:01:32,299
Hi. I'm Diane Selwyn.

416
01:01:32,512 --> 01:01:36,190
Just call me Coco, everybody
does. Pleased to meet you.

417
01:01:36,583 --> 01:01:39,501
Well, let 's eat!
I'm starving!

418
01:01:45,837 --> 01:01:47,949
I'm sorry I was late.

419
01:02:08,384 --> 01:02:11,017
I'm from Deep River, Ontario.

420
01:02:11,585 --> 01:02:15,369
- A small town.
- So you rolled in here from Canada.

421
01:02:18,230 --> 01:02:21,006
I always wanted to come here.

422
01:02:21,814 --> 01:02:25,005
I won this jitterbug contest.

423
01:02:25,711 --> 01:02:28,867
That sort of led to acting.

424
01:02:29,468 --> 01:02:32,873
You know, wanting to act.

425
01:02:33,574 --> 01:02:36,041
When my aunt died...

426
01:02:37,227 --> 01:02:40,181
Anyway, she left me some money.

427
01:02:40,916 --> 01:02:43,620
- She worked here.
- In the movies?

428
01:02:44,742 --> 01:02:46,130
Yes.

429
01:02:47,595 --> 01:02:49,921
How did you meet Camilla?

430
01:02:51,701 --> 01:02:55,556
- On the "Sylvia North Story".
- Camilla was great in that.

431
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:58,726
I never went to
Casablanca with Luigi.

432
01:02:58,938 --> 01:03:01,571
- What a pity!
- Then go!

433
01:03:11,186 --> 01:03:14,103
I wanted the lead so bad.

434
01:03:15,535 --> 01:03:18,939
Anyway, Camilla got the part.

435
01:03:22,076 --> 01:03:24,021
The director...

436
01:03:24,232 --> 01:03:26,177
Bob Rooker?

437
01:03:26,390 --> 01:03:28,157
Yes.

438
01:03:30,705 --> 01:03:33,516
He didn't think so much of me.

439
01:03:37,698 --> 01:03:40,544
Anyway, that 's when
we became friends.

440
01:03:42,117 --> 01:03:43,670
She helped me...

441
01:03:44,204 --> 01:03:47,300
getting some parts in some
of her films.

442
01:03:49,632 --> 01:03:51,684
I see.

443
01:04:06,541 --> 01:04:10,705
So I got the pool,
and she got the pool man.

444
01:04:13,082 --> 01:04:17,009
I couldn't believe it. I wanted
to buy that judge a Rolls Royce.

445
01:04:23,624 --> 01:04:26,400
Sometimes, good things happen.

446
01:05:20,094 --> 01:05:22,834
So I guess we've saved
the best for last.

447
01:05:26,288 --> 01:05:29,692
- Do you want to tell them?
- No, you tell them.

448
01:05:33,454 --> 01:05:35,886
Camilla and I...

449
01:05:48,033 --> 01:05:49,836
are going to be...

450
01:06:02,438 --> 01:06:04,490
Sorry about that.

451
01:06:11,970 --> 01:06:14,082
No, I'm fine.

452
01:06:19,799 --> 01:06:22,373
This is the girl.

453
01:06:23,382 --> 01:06:26,300
Don't show me this
fucking thing here.

454
01:06:27,001 --> 01:06:30,262
It 's just an actress' photo
resume. Everybody's got one.

455
01:06:31,872 --> 01:06:34,304
You got the money?

456
01:06:34,517 --> 01:06:36,593
I sure do.

457
01:06:47,808 --> 01:06:51,521
Okay, now, once you hand that over
to me, it 's a done deal.

458
01:06:54,975 --> 01:06:57,513
You sure you want this?

459
01:07:02,351 --> 01:07:05,269
More than anything in this world.

460
01:07:15,850 --> 01:07:18,911
When it 's finished, you'll find
this where I told you.

461
01:07:32,691 --> 01:07:35,502
What 's it open?

462
01:12:00,632 --> 01:12:02,734
Silence!

463
01:12:00,232 --> 01:12:02,734
Silencio.
