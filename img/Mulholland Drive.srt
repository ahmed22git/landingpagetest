1
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,969
What are you doing?
We don't stop here.

2
00:04:56,582 --> 00:04:58,743
Get out of the car.

3
00:08:29,608 --> 00:08:34,375
The boys found this on the floor,
in the back of the Caddy.

4
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,046
Yeah, they showed me.

5
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:41,251
Could be unrelated.

6
00:08:41,455 --> 00:08:43,184
Could be.

7
00:08:43,724 --> 00:08:46,785
Any of those dead kids
wearing pearl earrings?

8
00:08:46,995 --> 00:08:48,724
No.

9
00:08:49,597 --> 00:08:52,930
Could be someone's missing, maybe.

10
00:08:53,968 --> 00:08:56,061
That’s what I'm thinking.

11
00:09:32,042 --> 00:09:34,636
Just one more bag after that.

12
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:17,851
I just wanted to come here.

13
00:11:19,357 --> 00:11:21,222
To Winkie's?

14
00:11:21,826 --> 00:11:23,384
This Winkie's.

15
00:11:24,362 --> 00:11:27,958
Okay. Why this Winkie's?

16
00:11:31,703 --> 00:11:33,567
It’s kind of embarrassing.

17
00:11:36,308 --> 00:11:38,071
Go ahead.

18
00:11:39,445 --> 00:11:42,744
- I had a dream about this place.
- Oh, boy.

19
00:11:43,015 --> 00:11:44,676
See what I mean?

20
00:11:46,252 --> 00:11:50,188
Okay, so you had a dream
about this place.

21
00:11:51,624 --> 00:11:53,456
Tell me.

22
00:11:56,664 --> 00:11:58,290
Well...

23
00:11:59,867 --> 00:12:03,803
it’s the second one I've had.
But they're both the same.

24
00:12:05,606 --> 00:12:09,235
They start out that I'm in here but...

25
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:11,910
it’s not day or night...

26
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,675
it’s kind of half-night, you know?

27
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:17,678
But it looks just like this.

28
00:12:17,886 --> 00:12:19,820
Except for the light.

29
00:12:21,022 --> 00:12:24,082
And I'm scared like I can't
tell you.

30
00:12:26,061 --> 00:12:27,926
Of all people...

31
00:12:28,163 --> 00:12:30,632
you're standing right over there.

32
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:36,429
By that counter.

33
00:12:38,274 --> 00:12:41,574
You're in both dreams
and you're scared.

34
00:12:43,646 --> 00:12:46,980
I get even more frightened when
I see how afraid you are, and...

35
00:12:50,787 --> 00:12:53,312
then I realize what it is.

36
00:12:56,828 --> 00:12:58,989
There's a man...

37
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:01,892
in back of this place.

38
00:13:04,135 --> 00:13:06,365
He's the one who's doing it.

39
00:13:08,006 --> 00:13:10,736
I can see him through the wall.

40
00:13:10,942 --> 00:13:13,035
I can see his face.

41
00:13:18,617 --> 00:13:23,452
I hope that I never see that face
ever outside of the dream.

42
00:13:33,233 --> 00:13:35,201
That’s it.

43
00:13:35,568 --> 00:13:39,403
So... you came to see
if he's out there.

44
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:45,474
To get rid of this
god-awful feeling.

45
00:13:48,649 --> 00:13:50,310
Right then.

46
00:14:35,466 --> 00:14:37,195
It’s around the back.

47
00:15:43,105 --> 00:15:46,506
Dan! Dan, are you all right?

48
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:49,438
What is it, Dan? Dan?

49
00:16:13,938 --> 00:16:14,927
Hello?

50
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:19,806
The girl is still missing.

51
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:42,992
- Talk to me.
- The same.

52
00:17:19,641 --> 00:17:21,575
I can't believe it.

53
00:17:50,707 --> 00:17:53,699
Well, it's time to say
good-bye, Betty.

54
00:17:54,345 --> 00:17:57,109
- It’s been so nice traveling with you.
- Thank you, Irene.

55
00:17:57,315 --> 00:18:00,773
I was so excited and nervous. It was
sure great to have you to talk to.

56
00:18:01,118 --> 00:18:05,215
- I'll watch for you on the big screen.
- Okay, Irene.

57
00:18:05,424 --> 00:18:07,288
Won't that be the day?

58
00:18:07,492 --> 00:18:09,652
Good luck, Betty dear.

59
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:13,854
- Take care of yourself and be careful.
- I will.

60
00:18:14,066 --> 00:18:16,000
Thanks, again.

61
00:18:16,201 --> 00:18:19,068
Betty, it was so nice meeting you.
All the luck in the world.

62
00:18:19,271 --> 00:18:20,796
Thank you.

63
00:18:30,149 --> 00:18:32,640
- My bags?
- Where to?

64
00:18:34,053 --> 00:18:35,850
1612, Hayvenhurst.

65
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:40,026
Got it.

66
00:19:54,606 --> 00:19:58,975
- Ten bucks says you're Betty.
- Yes, I am, Mrs. Lenoix.

67
00:19:59,178 --> 00:20:03,047
- It is Mrs. Lenoix, isn't it?
- In all my living glory, baby.

68
00:20:03,817 --> 00:20:07,913
- Pleased to meet you.
- Call me Coco. Everybody else does.

69
00:20:08,121 --> 00:20:11,318
- Wait there and I'll go get the key.
- Okay, Coco.

70
00:20:15,762 --> 00:20:17,491
Wilkins!

71
00:20:17,697 --> 00:20:18,686
Wilkins!

72
00:20:18,898 --> 00:20:22,232
If that damn dog craps
in the courtyard one more time...

73
00:20:22,436 --> 00:20:27,135
I'm just gonna bank his little butt for
breakfast! You don't have any pets?

74
00:20:27,341 --> 00:20:28,968
- No, I don't.
- They're allowed.

75
00:20:29,176 --> 00:20:32,009
I just don't like them
in here for obvious reasons.

76
00:20:32,214 --> 00:20:36,513
There was a man that lived here once
that had a prizefighting kangaroo.

77
00:20:36,718 --> 00:20:41,883
You just wouldn't believe what that
kangaroo did to this courtyard.

78
00:20:42,724 --> 00:20:45,887
Let’s go see your aunt’s apartment.
It’s a good one.

79
00:20:46,094 --> 00:20:47,960
I can hardly wait.

80
00:20:55,037 --> 00:20:58,906
- It’s unbelievable!
- I told you.

81
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:04,174
You and your aunt probably have
an understanding, so here's the key.

82
00:21:04,381 --> 00:21:06,747
And if you need anything,
just give a holler.

83
00:21:06,949 --> 00:21:10,283
Everybody in this building is pretty
much okay with me...

84
00:21:10,487 --> 00:21:12,682
or they wouldn't be here.

85
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:16,050
If you like, later on
I'll introduce you around.

86
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,751
Well, no hard feelings if you don't.

87
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:44,984
I'm sorry. My aunt Ruth didn't tell
me someone was gonna be here.

88
00:22:45,188 --> 00:22:47,622
- I'm so sorry.
- It’s okay.

89
00:22:48,091 --> 00:22:53,257
I'm Ruth's niece. My name is Betty.
I'm sure she told you I was coming.

90
00:22:53,898 --> 00:22:57,698
There was an accident.
I came here.

91
00:22:57,902 --> 00:23:00,337
I understand. I saw the dress.

92
00:23:00,871 --> 00:23:03,238
I'm sorry. Are you all right?

93
00:23:04,175 --> 00:23:05,938
What happened?

94
00:23:07,178 --> 00:23:08,872
A car...

95
00:23:09,781 --> 00:23:11,772
a car accident.

96
00:23:13,785 --> 00:23:15,650
Are you okay?

97
00:23:17,989 --> 00:23:19,820
I think so.

98
00:23:20,358 --> 00:23:22,350
I was just...

99
00:23:22,861 --> 00:23:24,557
taking a shower.

100
00:23:24,764 --> 00:23:28,292
Oh, my God, I'm sorry.
I'll let you get back to that.

101
00:23:28,502 --> 00:23:30,765
I'm gonna get unpacked.

102
00:23:34,507 --> 00:23:36,339
What’s your name?

103
00:23:40,147 --> 00:23:43,674
I'm sorry, I'll get out of here.
We can talk later.

104
00:24:19,556 --> 00:24:21,023
My name is...

105
00:24:21,623 --> 00:24:23,091
Rita.

106
00:24:25,562 --> 00:24:27,553
Do you work with my aunt?

107
00:24:28,031 --> 00:24:31,660
- No, I...
- I'm sorry...

108
00:24:31,935 --> 00:24:33,994
it's none of my business.

109
00:24:37,541 --> 00:24:39,406
She has pretty red hair.

110
00:24:39,977 --> 00:24:41,877
She's letting me stay here while
she's working on a movie...

111
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:46,949
that's being made in Canada,
but I guess you already know that.

112
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:49,382
I couldn't afford a place like this
in a million years.

113
00:24:50,021 --> 00:24:53,355
Unless, of course, I'm discovered
and become a movie star.

114
00:24:53,558 --> 00:24:56,425
Of course, I'd rather be known as
a great actress than a movie star...

115
00:24:56,628 --> 00:24:59,722
but sometimes people
end up being both. So...

116
00:24:59,931 --> 00:25:03,162
that is, I guess you'd say,
the story of why I came here.

117
00:25:06,806 --> 00:25:10,264
I'm sorry. I'm just
so excited to be here.

118
00:25:10,476 --> 00:25:14,777
I just came here from Deep River,
Ontario, and now I'm in this...

119
00:25:15,515 --> 00:25:19,509
dream place!
Well, you can imagine how I feel.

120
00:25:27,529 --> 00:25:28,961
Sit down.

121
00:25:33,101 --> 00:25:35,092
Where were you hurt?

122
00:25:37,405 --> 00:25:39,270
- We should call a doctor.
- No.

123
00:25:39,474 --> 00:25:43,911
- But this could be serious.
- No, I need to sleep.

124
00:25:44,113 --> 00:25:46,240
If you have a concussion,
you shouldn't sleep.

125
00:25:46,449 --> 00:25:48,712
I'll be okay if I sleep.

126
00:25:48,918 --> 00:25:52,318
I just need to lie down
here and sleep.

127
00:26:47,347 --> 00:26:51,044
You see, Adam, there
are some suggestions...

128
00:26:51,251 --> 00:26:53,082
that ought to be brought forward.

129
00:26:53,286 --> 00:26:56,188
And I know you said you would
entertain suggestions.

130
00:26:56,389 --> 00:26:59,358
And that's all anybody
here is asking you to do.

131
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:04,127
- What are you talking about?
- An open mind.

132
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:09,494
You're in the process of recasting
your lead actress, and I'm...

133
00:27:10,638 --> 00:27:14,268
we are asking you to keep
an open mind.

134
00:27:24,286 --> 00:27:26,277
What was it the last time?

135
00:27:28,123 --> 00:27:33,117
- Okay, lets try the next one.
- He's not gonna like it.

136
00:27:33,829 --> 00:27:35,319
We'll see.

137
00:27:42,806 --> 00:27:46,070
Castigliani brothers!
Let me introduce you around.

138
00:27:47,744 --> 00:27:49,507
Please...

139
00:27:50,047 --> 00:27:53,141
take a seat. This is Mr. Darby,
whom you know.

140
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:56,478
And this is the director,
Adam Kesher.

141
00:27:56,687 --> 00:28:00,146
And his manager,
Robert Smith.

142
00:28:33,293 --> 00:28:35,318
She's very pretty.

143
00:28:36,663 --> 00:28:39,894
May I offer you gentlemen anything?

144
00:28:42,068 --> 00:28:44,594
- Espresso.
- Nothing.

145
00:28:44,838 --> 00:28:48,002
- What's the photo for?
- One espresso.

146
00:28:49,577 --> 00:28:51,568
No, that's it.

147
00:28:51,779 --> 00:28:53,974
I think you're going to enjoy
your espresso this time.

148
00:28:54,348 --> 00:28:56,339
I've done quite a bit of research...

149
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:58,018
knowing how hard
you are to please.

150
00:28:58,219 --> 00:29:00,154
This one comes
highly recommended.

151
00:29:00,422 --> 00:29:04,358
- What's the photo for?
- It's a recommendation.

152
00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:08,023
A recommendation to you, Adam.

153
00:29:09,464 --> 00:29:12,456
- It's not a recommendation.
- This is the girl.

154
00:29:13,136 --> 00:29:16,867
What girl? For what?
What is this, Ray?

155
00:29:17,373 --> 00:29:21,207
We'd be happy to put her on the
list for considerations.

156
00:29:21,411 --> 00:29:25,644
You'd be pleased to know, there's
quite a bit of interest in this role.

157
00:29:26,483 --> 00:29:30,782
Interest? There's six of the top
actresses that want this thing.

158
00:29:31,622 --> 00:29:33,180
This is the girl.

159
00:29:33,757 --> 00:29:36,419
- Ray, take care of this.
- Hold on, hold on, Adam.

160
00:29:36,627 --> 00:29:37,855
Hold on?

161
00:29:38,063 --> 00:29:40,530
There's no way!
There's no way!

162
00:29:55,013 --> 00:29:56,879
Napkin.

163
00:29:57,849 --> 00:29:59,408
Pardon?

164
00:29:59,618 --> 00:30:01,050
Napkin.

165
00:30:01,554 --> 00:30:03,385
Of course.

166
00:30:03,889 --> 00:30:05,379
Excuse me.

167
00:30:21,641 --> 00:30:23,370
Is that all, sir?

168
00:31:18,436 --> 00:31:21,633
- Shit.
- Sorry. That was highly recommended.

169
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:24,330
That is considered one of the finest
espressos in the world!

170
00:31:24,542 --> 00:31:27,909
What's going on here? There is
no way that girl is in my movie!

171
00:31:32,017 --> 00:31:36,249
- This is the girl.
- Hey, that girl is not in my film!

172
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:41,285
It's no longer your film.

173
00:31:46,365 --> 00:31:48,060
This is the girl.

174
00:32:25,573 --> 00:32:28,372
Castigliani brothers get out
of that limo?

175
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:30,740
- The two guys in dark suits?
- Yeah.

176
00:32:30,946 --> 00:32:33,676
- Yes.
- Leave that door open.

177
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:45,121
Castigliani brothers?

178
00:32:45,328 --> 00:32:47,023
Beat it, pal.

179
00:33:30,009 --> 00:33:31,670
Good afternoon, Mr. Roque.

180
00:33:33,913 --> 00:33:37,007
Her name is Camilla Rhodes.

181
00:33:38,017 --> 00:33:40,282
The director doesn't want her.

182
00:33:43,724 --> 00:33:46,192
Do you want him replaced?

183
00:33:48,929 --> 00:33:50,760
I know they said...

184
00:33:52,934 --> 00:33:54,526
Then?

185
00:33:55,203 --> 00:33:56,670
Then...

186
00:33:57,606 --> 00:33:59,938
that means we should...?

187
00:34:02,911 --> 00:34:04,378
Yes?

188
00:34:05,982 --> 00:34:09,576
Shut everything down?
Is that something that...

189
00:34:11,887 --> 00:34:15,618
Do you want us to shut
everything down?

190
00:34:20,796 --> 00:34:23,698
Then we'll shut everything down.

191
00:34:51,764 --> 00:34:55,325
Oh, man, that's unheard of.

192
00:34:55,534 --> 00:34:58,594
An accident like that, who could
have foreseen that, man?

193
00:35:01,206 --> 00:35:03,936
- It's unreal, right?
- Yeah.

194
00:35:05,177 --> 00:35:07,203
Unbelievable, man.

195
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:15,854
So, bro? God, you look good.

196
00:35:16,389 --> 00:35:19,256
- What have you been doing?
- You know, just...

197
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:21,052
doing some stuff
for this guy.

198
00:35:22,363 --> 00:35:24,057
Are you making ends meet?

199
00:35:24,265 --> 00:35:25,857
Hardly.

200
00:35:27,635 --> 00:35:30,968
I know, man, look at my digs.

201
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:34,668
Times are tough, bro.

202
00:35:35,609 --> 00:35:38,738
Hey... man, it's not that bad.

203
00:35:39,847 --> 00:35:42,339
I hope you're not gonna
get in any trouble.

204
00:35:42,551 --> 00:35:45,418
That was just a thing, man.
That story? That made you laugh!

205
00:35:45,654 --> 00:35:49,784
- That was a funny story, man.
- Fucking car accident!

206
00:35:52,428 --> 00:35:55,022
Hey, so that's... that's it, huh?

207
00:35:55,231 --> 00:35:57,563
That's Ed's famous black book.

208
00:36:00,536 --> 00:36:02,936
The history of the world...

209
00:36:03,406 --> 00:36:05,135
in phone numbers.

210
00:36:33,671 --> 00:36:35,400
Oh, man!

211
00:36:47,586 --> 00:36:50,181
Something bit me bad!

212
00:37:38,041 --> 00:37:39,303
Hey, man!

213
00:37:39,509 --> 00:37:42,967
She's hurt real bad! Could you come
here and call on the phone, please?

214
00:37:43,947 --> 00:37:47,349
She's hurt real bad! You gotta
come in here and call the hospital!

215
00:37:48,618 --> 00:37:52,952
Come on, man! I'm serious about this!
I can't do everything by myself!

216
00:38:12,744 --> 00:38:14,075
Hey, man.

217
00:38:53,955 --> 00:38:55,582
Oh, man!

218
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:16,543
Aunt Ruth, I'll try. I'm gonna study
those lines until I know them...

219
00:39:16,745 --> 00:39:18,839
inside out.

220
00:39:19,049 --> 00:39:22,041
Either right here on
this fabulous leather couch...

221
00:39:22,252 --> 00:39:23,981
or I'll take them with
a coffee into the courtyard...

222
00:39:24,187 --> 00:39:26,280
like a regular movie star.

223
00:39:26,756 --> 00:39:29,225
I got a real shock to find your
friend Rita here.

224
00:39:29,426 --> 00:39:32,327
She was in the shower
and I opened the door!

225
00:39:32,596 --> 00:39:34,325
Rita!

226
00:39:34,831 --> 00:39:36,459
What do you mean?

227
00:39:37,435 --> 00:39:39,460
She was in an accident.

228
00:39:40,638 --> 00:39:43,164
Rita. Your friend.

229
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:47,177
No, Coco unlocked the door.

230
00:39:48,547 --> 00:39:50,708
No, she didn't see her.

231
00:39:51,649 --> 00:39:53,675
She's sleeping.

232
00:39:54,619 --> 00:39:58,612
I'm sure there's some explanation for
this. I don't think we have to do that.

233
00:40:00,994 --> 00:40:05,021
Please, don't worry. Aunt Ruth,
we don't need the police.

234
00:40:18,045 --> 00:40:19,774
You're awake.

235
00:40:23,484 --> 00:40:25,213
I think I misunderstood.

236
00:40:25,586 --> 00:40:28,714
I thought you knew my aunt
and that's why you were here.

237
00:40:29,224 --> 00:40:32,215
I just talked to my aunt on the phone
and she wants me to call the police.

238
00:40:38,666 --> 00:40:40,293
Rita?

239
00:40:43,571 --> 00:40:45,732
I'm sorry, I...

240
00:40:46,208 --> 00:40:48,141
What is it, Rita?

241
00:40:51,447 --> 00:40:56,043
I thought when I woke up...
I thought sleep would do it.

242
00:40:56,853 --> 00:40:58,821
What's wrong?

243
00:41:00,656 --> 00:41:02,921
I just don't know who I am.

244
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:06,485
- What do you mean? You're Rita.
- No, I'm not.

245
00:41:07,396 --> 00:41:09,763
I don't know what my name is.

246
00:41:09,966 --> 00:41:12,128
I don't know who I am.

247
00:41:22,112 --> 00:41:25,776
This is your purse.
Your name must be in your purse.

248
00:41:27,718 --> 00:41:29,812
You wanna know, don't you?

249
00:41:30,889 --> 00:41:32,982
- Yes, but...
- Open it.

250
00:43:04,155 --> 00:43:07,215
- Sure you don't want anything?
- Not here.

251
00:43:07,425 --> 00:43:09,188
- Thanks.
- A drink or something?

252
00:43:09,395 --> 00:43:11,589
No. Thanks, though.

253
00:43:12,263 --> 00:43:15,027
I'll take a cigarette,
if you have one.

254
00:43:17,803 --> 00:43:20,271
Yeah, just reach inside my
shirt pocket there.

255
00:43:24,910 --> 00:43:27,606
Any new girls on the street lately?

256
00:43:29,349 --> 00:43:30,646
No.

257
00:43:31,217 --> 00:43:33,412
I haven't seen any.

258
00:43:34,721 --> 00:43:36,712
A brunette?

259
00:43:36,923 --> 00:43:39,448
Maybe a little beat-up?

260
00:43:39,659 --> 00:43:41,093
No.

261
00:43:44,965 --> 00:43:48,402
- Keep your eyes open for me, okay?
- Sure.

262
00:43:49,403 --> 00:43:50,631
You bet you will.

263
00:43:53,541 --> 00:43:55,566
That money...

264
00:43:57,511 --> 00:44:00,309
you don't know where it came from?

265
00:44:02,718 --> 00:44:06,882
When you think of them,
the money and the key...

266
00:44:08,791 --> 00:44:11,657
does it make you
remember anything?

267
00:44:13,595 --> 00:44:16,326
There's something...

268
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,429
something...

269
00:44:19,636 --> 00:44:22,298
there.

270
00:44:31,982 --> 00:44:33,449
What did you say?

271
00:44:33,650 --> 00:44:37,087
- They fired everyone.
- Who fired everyone?

272
00:44:37,656 --> 00:44:41,557
Ray did!
Wait! I'm talking on the phone.

273
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:46,829
They closed the set. Everybody's
gone. You'd better get down here.

274
00:44:48,033 --> 00:44:49,557
No.

275
00:44:49,768 --> 00:44:52,236
You've gotta talk to Ray.
You've gotta fix this.

276
00:44:52,437 --> 00:44:53,962
I'm going home.

277
00:44:54,173 --> 00:44:55,400
Home?

278
00:44:55,607 --> 00:44:59,099
Meet me at the office, we gotta do
something. You gotta do something!

279
00:44:59,311 --> 00:45:03,373
- I'm going home, Cynthia.
- Adam, this isn't like you.

280
00:45:03,582 --> 00:45:06,415
Please, come to the office. There's
gotta be something we can do!

281
00:45:06,619 --> 00:45:08,484
I'm going home.

282
00:45:18,265 --> 00:45:20,825
I wonder where you were going.

283
00:45:25,038 --> 00:45:27,006
Mulholland Drive.

284
00:45:31,879 --> 00:45:33,607
Mulholland Drive?

285
00:45:35,817 --> 00:45:37,842
That's where I was going.

286
00:45:38,519 --> 00:45:40,851
Mulholland Drive.

287
00:45:42,023 --> 00:45:45,084
Maybe that's where
the accident was.

288
00:45:45,761 --> 00:45:48,821
There must be a police report.
We could call.

289
00:45:49,498 --> 00:45:53,401
We could call anonymously just
to see if there was an accident.

290
00:45:54,337 --> 00:45:59,501
It'll be just like in the movies!
We'll pretend to be someone else.

291
00:46:01,043 --> 00:46:02,943
I wanna walk around, anyway.

292
00:46:03,146 --> 00:46:05,774
I'm in Hollywood and
I haven't even seen any of it.

293
00:46:06,249 --> 00:46:09,047
Come on, Rita,
do you feel up to it?

294
00:46:16,327 --> 00:46:17,885
Okay.

295
00:46:18,095 --> 00:46:20,290
But just...

296
00:46:22,099 --> 00:46:24,363
just to see.

297
00:46:24,568 --> 00:46:28,266
Just to see if there was
an accident...

298
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:31,165
on Mulholland Drive.

299
00:47:11,886 --> 00:47:13,615
Lorraine?

300
00:47:14,856 --> 00:47:16,949
You're home?

301
00:47:19,761 --> 00:47:21,662
Lorraine?

302
00:47:40,917 --> 00:47:42,748
Now you've done it!

303
00:47:45,021 --> 00:47:48,184
Just forget you ever saw it.
It's better that way.

304
00:47:51,328 --> 00:47:53,763
What the hell are you
even doing here?

305
00:48:05,309 --> 00:48:07,573
What are you doing?

306
00:48:10,749 --> 00:48:12,944
That's my jewelry!

307
00:48:29,035 --> 00:48:33,768
- That bastard. You bastard!
- He's probably upset, Lorraine.

308
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:42,013
What are you doing?

309
00:48:43,717 --> 00:48:45,207
Stop it!

310
00:48:45,419 --> 00:48:46,716
Stop it!

311
00:48:47,087 --> 00:48:48,884
Adam, stop it!

312
00:48:49,691 --> 00:48:51,283
Stop it!

313
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:52,956
Stop it!

314
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:59,321
You're hurting me! Gene!

315
00:48:59,533 --> 00:49:01,399
You're hurting me!

316
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:07,939
That ain't no way to treat your
wife. I don't care what she's done.

317
00:49:09,278 --> 00:49:11,405
Throw him out!

318
00:49:11,847 --> 00:49:13,473
Throw him out!

319
00:49:14,249 --> 00:49:16,184
Damn you, Adam!

320
00:49:16,752 --> 00:49:18,447
Throw him out!

321
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:26,152
Get out!

322
00:50:03,969 --> 00:50:05,960
Let's hide it.

323
00:50:49,284 --> 00:50:51,275
There's one.

324
00:51:06,602 --> 00:51:09,264
- Los Angeles Police Department.
- I'm inquiring about an accident...

325
00:51:09,473 --> 00:51:13,671
...last night on Mulholland Drive.
- I'll connect you to Traffic.

326
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:18,982
- Sergeant Baker.
- Hi, I'm inquiring...

327
00:51:20,984 --> 00:51:25,251
I heard a sound last night that
sounded sort of like a car crash.

328
00:51:25,456 --> 00:51:28,153
I want to know if there was an
accident on Mulholland Drive.

329
00:51:28,359 --> 00:51:30,327
Yes, there was.

330
00:51:30,528 --> 00:51:33,326
- Can you tell me what happened?
- No, I can't.

331
00:51:33,531 --> 00:51:36,160
- Was anyone hurt?
- May I have your name, please?

332
00:51:42,708 --> 00:51:44,801
There was an accident.

333
00:51:45,010 --> 00:51:48,502
He wouldn't tell me anything else,
but that was your accident, Rita.

334
00:51:50,217 --> 00:51:52,548
Maybe there's something
about it in the papers.

335
00:51:52,886 --> 00:51:54,978
Come on, I'll buy you a cup of
coffee and we can see.

336
00:51:59,025 --> 00:52:02,461
Maybe it happened so late it's
not in today's paper.

337
00:52:02,662 --> 00:52:04,790
There's nothing?

338
00:52:05,933 --> 00:52:08,196
Not that I can see.

339
00:52:09,771 --> 00:52:11,136
That's okay.

340
00:52:15,643 --> 00:52:17,373
Thanks.

341
00:52:18,946 --> 00:52:20,641
Diane.

342
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:27,613
Will that be all?
Would you like your check?

343
00:52:28,323 --> 00:52:30,314
Rita, you want something?

344
00:52:32,327 --> 00:52:36,560
- No, just... just the coffee.
- We'll take our check.

345
00:52:43,606 --> 00:52:45,597
What is it, Rita?

346
00:52:53,249 --> 00:52:57,516
I remember something.
I remember something!

347
00:53:00,424 --> 00:53:03,723
- What is it?
- Diane Selwyn.

348
00:53:03,929 --> 00:53:06,226
Maybe that's my name!

349
00:53:11,469 --> 00:53:14,404
"D. Selwyn." It's the only one.

350
00:53:15,340 --> 00:53:16,967
I'm gonna call.

351
00:53:24,283 --> 00:53:28,219
- It is strange to be calling yourself.
- Maybe it's not me.

352
00:53:36,864 --> 00:53:38,456
Hello, it's me.

353
00:53:38,665 --> 00:53:40,656
Leave a message.

354
00:53:42,736 --> 00:53:44,727
That's not my voice.

355
00:53:46,073 --> 00:53:48,634
But I know her!

356
00:53:49,977 --> 00:53:55,439
Maybe that isn't Diane Selwyn's
voice. Maybe that's your roommate.

357
00:53:55,650 --> 00:53:59,780
Or if it is Diane Selwyn,
she could tell you who you are.

358
00:54:01,055 --> 00:54:02,921
Maybe.

359
00:54:03,291 --> 00:54:05,418
Maybe, maybe...

360
00:54:38,129 --> 00:54:39,892
Adam Kesher?

361
00:54:43,234 --> 00:54:45,702
- Adam Kesher?
- Get lost!

362
00:54:45,903 --> 00:54:48,304
- This is Adam Kesher's house.
- Like hell it is! Get out now!

363
00:54:48,506 --> 00:54:49,700
Get out!

364
00:54:51,810 --> 00:54:53,437
Adam Kesher?

365
00:54:58,483 --> 00:55:02,011
Get out of here!
He's never coming back! Ever!

366
00:55:03,588 --> 00:55:06,023
- Bastard.
- I guess you don't understand English.

367
00:55:06,225 --> 00:55:08,193
She said leave. Here's the door.

368
00:55:08,393 --> 00:55:09,724
Gene!

369
00:55:10,196 --> 00:55:11,493
Get out!

370
00:55:12,165 --> 00:55:13,598
Get out!

371
00:55:17,670 --> 00:55:19,229
Adam Kesher?

372
00:55:40,996 --> 00:55:43,829
- Yeah, what is it, Cookie?
- I'm sorry, Mr. Kesher...

373
00:55:44,032 --> 00:55:47,400
but there seems to be some
problem with your credit cards.

374
00:55:48,269 --> 00:55:50,465
What? I pay you cash, Cookie.

375
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:56,343
Listen, two guys from
your bank came by.

376
00:55:56,979 --> 00:55:58,708
My bank?

377
00:55:59,615 --> 00:56:02,311
- How'd they know I was here?
- I don't know.

378
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:05,584
What'd they say?

379
00:56:05,789 --> 00:56:09,316
They said to tell you that you're
maxed out at your bank...

380
00:56:09,526 --> 00:56:12,654
and that your line of credit
has been canceled.

381
00:56:14,365 --> 00:56:16,298
That's unbelievable.

382
00:56:17,868 --> 00:56:19,529
Well, look...

383
00:56:21,906 --> 00:56:26,605
I don't know what's going on.
That is so much baloney.

384
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:34,543
- I got enough cash for you, Cookie.
- I know, I know. Don't worry.

385
00:56:35,319 --> 00:56:40,121
But I'm sorry, it's my duty
to inform you...

386
00:56:41,393 --> 00:56:45,922
listen, man,
whoever you're hiding from...

387
00:56:46,132 --> 00:56:48,692
they know where you are.

388
00:56:49,769 --> 00:56:51,498
Right.

389
00:56:52,472 --> 00:56:54,372
I'm sorry.

390
00:57:16,997 --> 00:57:17,986
Hello?

391
00:57:18,332 --> 00:57:21,791
- Someone maybe shut off my money.
- I know. Where are you, Adam?

392
00:57:22,137 --> 00:57:26,301
- Sorry, what do you mean you know?
- Somebody called...

393
00:57:26,508 --> 00:57:30,536
they told me you were as good as
broke. So I made a few calls.

394
00:57:31,113 --> 00:57:32,910
- And?
- You're broke.

395
00:57:33,115 --> 00:57:34,413
I'm not broke!

396
00:57:34,917 --> 00:57:37,112
I know, but you're broke.
Where are you?

397
00:57:38,554 --> 00:57:42,651
- I'm at Cookie's, downtown.
- Do you know somebody called...

398
00:57:43,192 --> 00:57:44,819
"The Cowboy"?

399
00:57:45,795 --> 00:57:47,991
- "The cowboy"?
- Yeah.

400
00:57:48,564 --> 00:57:52,626
"The Cowboy". This guy,
the Cowboy, wants to see you.

401
00:57:52,836 --> 00:57:55,737
Jason said he thought
it would be a good idea.

402
00:57:56,607 --> 00:57:59,667
Jason thought it would be a good
idea for me to go see the Cowboy.

403
00:57:59,877 --> 00:58:03,040
Should I wear my 1O-gallon hat
and my six-shooters?

404
00:58:03,448 --> 00:58:06,542
Something tells me that this guy
is connected to what's happening.

405
00:58:07,685 --> 00:58:10,950
Adam, I think you should do it, and
you should do it right away.

406
00:58:11,356 --> 00:58:16,056
- What's going on, Cynthia?
- It's been a very strange day.

407
00:58:17,396 --> 00:58:19,886
And getting stranger.

408
00:58:21,433 --> 00:58:24,698
Where do I meet this Cowboy? Do you
have to ride out to the range?

409
00:58:25,437 --> 00:58:29,703
Sort of, funny boy.
If I tell him the meeting's on...

410
00:58:30,109 --> 00:58:35,241
you'll go to the top of the Beachwood
Canyon, there's a corral up there...

411
00:58:35,448 --> 00:58:38,679
...where he'll be.
- You've gotta be kidding me.

412
00:58:39,052 --> 00:58:41,213
Will you meet with him?

413
00:58:41,421 --> 00:58:42,582
Yeah.

414
00:58:42,790 --> 00:58:46,691
Sure. This has been
that kind of a day. When?

415
00:58:46,993 --> 00:58:50,589
I'll call him right away
and then I'll call you back.

416
00:58:51,432 --> 00:58:55,391
You know, you could stay at
my place, if you wanted.

417
00:58:55,803 --> 00:59:00,741
- I don't think that'd be a good idea.
- I was just offering a place to stay.

418
00:59:00,943 --> 00:59:04,106
Yes, and I appreciate the offer,
Cynthia. I'll find a place.

419
00:59:04,313 --> 00:59:07,180
Just go on and give that cowboy
a yodel and get on back to me.

420
00:59:07,382 --> 00:59:10,783
Okay. But you don't know
what you're missing.

421
00:59:10,986 --> 00:59:13,819
Just get along, little doggie.
And call me back.

422
00:59:25,436 --> 00:59:29,372
It's right about here. Sierra Bonita.
It's not too far away.

423
00:59:30,740 --> 00:59:32,867
What's wrong with that?

424
00:59:33,643 --> 00:59:35,908
I'm not sure about this.

425
00:59:37,248 --> 00:59:40,183
I know you're afraid of something.

426
00:59:40,785 --> 00:59:43,651
We'll be careful. I promise.

427
00:59:44,288 --> 00:59:47,724
Tomorrow. We'll go over there...

428
00:59:47,926 --> 00:59:49,894
and we'll find out.

429
01:00:02,575 --> 01:00:04,702
It'll be okay.

430
01:00:06,879 --> 01:00:09,279
It's probably Coco.

431
01:00:12,719 --> 01:00:16,951
- Yes, may I help you?
- Someone is in trouble!

432
01:00:18,659 --> 01:00:20,889
Who are you?

433
01:00:21,595 --> 01:00:24,224
What are you doing
in Ruth's apartment?

434
01:00:24,698 --> 01:00:28,863
She's letting me stay here.
I'm her niece. My name's Betty.

435
01:00:29,070 --> 01:00:32,732
No, it's not!
That's not what she said.

436
01:00:33,174 --> 01:00:37,042
Someone is in trouble!
Something bad is happening!

437
01:00:37,979 --> 01:00:41,142
I'm sorry, but I don't know
who you are and...

438
01:00:41,350 --> 01:00:44,614
Louise?
What are you doing, Louise?

439
01:00:45,254 --> 01:00:49,691
I've been trying to get hold of you
since 3 o'clock this afternoon.

440
01:00:49,892 --> 01:00:52,986
That one is in my room and
she won't leave!

441
01:00:53,195 --> 01:00:56,131
I want you to get her out.
I want you to get her out now.

442
01:00:56,865 --> 01:00:59,926
This is Louise Bonner.
I'm sure she meant well.

443
01:01:00,136 --> 01:01:02,969
Louise, this is Betty,
this is Ruth's niece.

444
01:01:03,173 --> 01:01:08,202
I was on my way over here to see
Betty. Betty is a young actress.

445
01:01:08,412 --> 01:01:12,279
I was delivering some faxed pages of
a scene for a big audition tomorrow.

446
01:01:12,483 --> 01:01:15,179
- Well, here they are, honey.
- Thank you.

447
01:01:15,386 --> 01:01:17,684
Come along now, Louise.
I'll take you home.

448
01:01:17,888 --> 01:01:19,822
I'm sorry.
It happens sometimes. Come on.

449
01:01:20,024 --> 01:01:23,050
No, she said it was someone
else who was in trouble.

450
01:01:23,260 --> 01:01:26,992
Stop it, Louise!
I'm taking you home. Come on.

451
01:01:28,032 --> 01:01:30,227
- Good night, Betty.
- Good night.

452
01:01:31,235 --> 01:01:32,931
Good night.

453
01:02:10,344 --> 01:02:12,279
Cowboy...

454
01:03:16,815 --> 01:03:19,875
- Howdy.
- Howdy to you.

455
01:03:22,354 --> 01:03:24,549
Beautiful evening.

456
01:03:27,794 --> 01:03:31,286
Thank you for coming all the way
up here to see me from that...

457
01:03:31,498 --> 01:03:33,432
nice hotel downtown.

458
01:03:34,934 --> 01:03:37,903
No problem.
What's on your mind?

459
01:03:38,105 --> 01:03:41,767
Well, now. Here's a man who
wants to get right down to it.

460
01:03:42,308 --> 01:03:44,971
Kind of anxious
to get to it, are you?

461
01:03:45,179 --> 01:03:46,941
Whatever.

462
01:03:48,349 --> 01:03:50,681
A man's attitude...

463
01:03:50,918 --> 01:03:55,788
a man's attitude goes some ways
the way his life will be.

464
01:03:56,457 --> 01:03:58,891
Is that something
you might agree with?

465
01:03:59,694 --> 01:04:01,321
Sure!

466
01:04:01,530 --> 01:04:05,193
Did you answer because that's what
you thought I wanted to hear...

467
01:04:05,401 --> 01:04:07,369
or did you think about what I said...

468
01:04:07,569 --> 01:04:11,631
and answered 'cause you
truly believe that to be right?

469
01:04:12,375 --> 01:04:15,936
I agree with what you said. Truly.

470
01:04:17,947 --> 01:04:20,575
What'd I say?

471
01:04:22,386 --> 01:04:26,152
That a man's attitude determines to
a large extent how his life will be.

472
01:04:27,690 --> 01:04:30,023
So since you agree...

473
01:04:30,227 --> 01:04:35,096
you must be a person who does not
care about the good life.

474
01:04:35,399 --> 01:04:37,230
How's that?

475
01:04:38,702 --> 01:04:40,932
Well, stop for a little second...

476
01:04:41,172 --> 01:04:44,869
and think about it.
Can you do that for me?

477
01:04:47,011 --> 01:04:50,071
Okay. I'm thinking.

478
01:04:53,351 --> 01:04:58,755
No, you're not. You're too busy
being a smart aleck to be thinking.

479
01:04:59,491 --> 01:05:03,587
Now, I want you to think
and stop being a smart aleck.

480
01:05:03,796 --> 01:05:05,923
Can you try that for me?

481
01:05:06,132 --> 01:05:09,658
Look, where's this going?
What do you want me to do?

482
01:05:10,569 --> 01:05:15,598
There's sometimes a buggy.
How many drivers does a buggy have?

483
01:05:16,376 --> 01:05:17,673
One.

484
01:05:18,345 --> 01:05:21,474
So let's just say
I'm driving this buggy.

485
01:05:21,681 --> 01:05:26,142
And if you fix your attitude,
you can ride along with me.

486
01:05:28,356 --> 01:05:30,687
I want you to go back
to work tomorrow.

487
01:05:31,626 --> 01:05:37,258
You were recasting the lead actress.
Audition many girls for the part.

488
01:05:38,133 --> 01:05:42,967
When you see the girl that was shown
to you earlier today, you will say:

489
01:05:43,372 --> 01:05:46,205
"This is the girl."

490
01:05:46,541 --> 01:05:50,033
The rest of the cast can stay.
That's up to you.

491
01:05:50,912 --> 01:05:54,075
But that lead girl
is not up to you.

492
01:05:55,951 --> 01:06:00,286
Now, you will see me one more
time if you do good.

493
01:06:01,257 --> 01:06:06,092
You'll see me two more times
if you do bad.

494
01:06:06,697 --> 01:06:08,221
Good night.

495
01:06:33,191 --> 01:06:36,854
- You're still here?
- I thought that's what you wanted.

496
01:06:37,063 --> 01:06:40,965
- Nobody wants you here!
- Really?

497
01:06:41,166 --> 01:06:44,068
My parents are right upstairs.
They think you've left!

498
01:06:44,270 --> 01:06:48,172
- So? Surprise.
- I can call them. I can call my dad.

499
01:06:48,607 --> 01:06:52,202
- But you won't.
- Lf you're trying to blackmail me...

500
01:06:52,879 --> 01:06:55,438
it's not going to work! You're
playing a dangerous game here.

501
01:06:55,648 --> 01:06:57,913
You know what I want.
It's not that difficult.

502
01:06:58,185 --> 01:07:01,382
Get out!
Get out before I call my dad!

503
01:07:01,588 --> 01:07:04,489
He trusts you!
You're his best friend.

504
01:07:04,691 --> 01:07:06,750
This will be the
end of everything.

505
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:09,691
What about you?
What will your dad think about you?

506
01:07:09,896 --> 01:07:13,628
Stop! Just stop it! That's what
you said from the beginning.

507
01:07:14,435 --> 01:07:17,529
If I tell what happened, they'll
arrest you and put you in jail.

508
01:07:17,739 --> 01:07:20,071
Get out of here before...

509
01:07:20,908 --> 01:07:24,071
- Before what?
- Before...

510
01:07:24,278 --> 01:07:28,681
...I kill you.
- Then they'd put you in jail.

511
01:07:32,154 --> 01:07:35,419
Then I cry, cry, cry,
and then I say with big emotion...

512
01:07:35,624 --> 01:07:38,492
"I hate you! I hate us both!"

513
01:07:41,430 --> 01:07:44,992
- Such a lame scene.
- But you are really good.

514
01:07:46,136 --> 01:07:48,297
Thank you, darling.

515
01:08:02,484 --> 01:08:05,009
Hi, there. Who are you?

516
01:08:08,057 --> 01:08:09,820
Betty?

517
01:08:16,365 --> 01:08:19,232
Betty, can I see you outside
for a minute?

518
01:08:31,836 --> 01:08:33,598
What is it, Coco?

519
01:08:33,837 --> 01:08:35,236
Your aunt called.

520
01:08:36,707 --> 01:08:38,139
I was afraid of that.

521
01:08:38,342 --> 01:08:41,106
She wants to know who's
staying in her apartment.

522
01:08:42,013 --> 01:08:44,777
It's just for a night or two.
Until she finds her own place.

523
01:08:44,982 --> 01:08:47,246
I tried to explain that to aunt Ruth
but the connection was bad...

524
01:08:47,451 --> 01:08:50,420
and her plane was leaving,
and she got it all mixed up.

525
01:08:50,622 --> 01:08:52,384
I kept telling her
that it was my friend Rita...

526
01:08:52,591 --> 01:08:54,786
and she kept saying
she didn't know any Ritas.

527
01:08:55,993 --> 01:08:59,896
- Look at me straight, sweetie.
- Coco, she's very nice.

528
01:09:00,098 --> 01:09:01,827
Honey, you're a good kid...

529
01:09:02,035 --> 01:09:05,060
but what you're telling me is
a load of horse puckey.

530
01:09:05,572 --> 01:09:07,870
Even though it
comes from a good place.

531
01:09:08,074 --> 01:09:10,405
I'm gonna trust you
to sort this thing out.

532
01:09:11,144 --> 01:09:14,204
- Thank you.
- Don't make me out to be a sucker.

533
01:09:14,747 --> 01:09:18,205
Louise Bonner said there is trouble
in there, remember last night?

534
01:09:18,786 --> 01:09:22,244
Well, sometimes she's wrong...

535
01:09:22,456 --> 01:09:26,552
but if there is trouble,
get rid of it.

536
01:09:35,770 --> 01:09:37,738
Is everything all right?

537
01:09:37,938 --> 01:09:42,933
- Is it bad for you that I'm here?
- No, no, everything is A-Okay.

538
01:09:43,144 --> 01:09:48,138
Now, I've gotta fix that sandwich.
And my audition is in one hour!

539
01:10:07,237 --> 01:10:09,569
I hope I'm back
in a couple of hours.

540
01:10:09,973 --> 01:10:12,874
- And don't drink all the Coke.
- Good luck.

541
01:10:13,077 --> 01:10:16,807
When I get back, I'll keep the
cab waiting, so be ready to go.

542
01:10:45,879 --> 01:10:46,970
"Voilà!"

543
01:10:47,813 --> 01:10:50,543
Betty Elms, I would
like you to meet...

544
01:10:50,750 --> 01:10:52,842
Jack Tutman, my assistant.

545
01:10:53,887 --> 01:10:56,856
Woody Katz, who we have
cast in the part of Chuck...

546
01:10:57,057 --> 01:10:59,287
and will do the scene with you.

547
01:10:59,993 --> 01:11:01,984
Bob Rooker, our director...

548
01:11:02,195 --> 01:11:04,130
and Julie Chadwick.

549
01:11:04,665 --> 01:11:08,533
Now, our surprise guest,
Lynne James.

550
01:11:08,736 --> 01:11:11,671
Alas, we can't afford her to
cast our show but...

551
01:11:11,872 --> 01:11:15,866
well, as casting agents go,
she is the best.

552
01:11:16,410 --> 01:11:19,403
Why, thank you, Wally.
Hello, Betty.

553
01:11:19,848 --> 01:11:23,477
- Very pleased to meet you.
- This is my assistant, Nikki.

554
01:11:24,252 --> 01:11:29,451
And the ever lovely Martha. Martha
Johnson, whom you met out front.

555
01:11:31,728 --> 01:11:32,955
Hi.

556
01:11:33,596 --> 01:11:37,088
So, shall we give it a go?

557
01:11:37,834 --> 01:11:41,429
Would you like a water,
a coffee before we begin?

558
01:11:41,637 --> 01:11:43,434
No, I'm fine.

559
01:11:43,639 --> 01:11:46,507
Well then,
let's everyone take a seat.

560
01:11:49,445 --> 01:11:55,316
Betty, why don't you join Woody
over there and we'll play the scene.

561
01:11:55,519 --> 01:11:58,386
Bob, do you have anything
you wish to say?

562
01:11:59,089 --> 01:12:01,614
Something to Betty
before we begin?

563
01:12:01,825 --> 01:12:04,226
No. It's not a contest.

564
01:12:05,496 --> 01:12:07,192
The two of them...

565
01:12:08,066 --> 01:12:10,500
with themselves.

566
01:12:11,136 --> 01:12:14,698
So don't play it for real...

567
01:12:14,907 --> 01:12:17,704
until it gets real.

568
01:12:22,548 --> 01:12:24,209
Okay.

569
01:12:24,817 --> 01:12:26,979
Just tell me where it hurts, baby.

570
01:12:27,187 --> 01:12:28,210
What?

571
01:12:28,421 --> 01:12:31,948
I wanna play this one nice and close
like we did with that other girl...

572
01:12:32,292 --> 01:12:35,591
what's her name? With the black
hair. It felt good, what do you think?

573
01:12:35,796 --> 01:12:39,789
That's good, Woody. Just don't rush
that line again. I told you...

574
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,662
the line where you say:
"Before what?"

575
01:12:43,570 --> 01:12:49,271
Bobby, acting is reacting.
I just play off them. They all say:

576
01:12:49,943 --> 01:12:52,811
"They're gonna arrest you", like
that, and: "They'll put you in jail."

577
01:12:53,014 --> 01:12:56,245
They say it the same way.
So when they say it, I just react.

578
01:12:56,452 --> 01:12:57,713
- What's your name?
- Betty.

579
01:12:57,919 --> 01:13:02,755
Betty, look. You don't rush it,
I don't rush it, okay?

580
01:13:02,958 --> 01:13:08,453
Now, we're gonna play this nice and
close just like in the movies, okay?

581
01:13:11,100 --> 01:13:13,830
Dad's best friend goes to work.

582
01:13:14,938 --> 01:13:16,404
Bob?

583
01:13:18,641 --> 01:13:20,108
And...

584
01:13:20,877 --> 01:13:22,538
action!

585
01:13:26,316 --> 01:13:28,181
You're still here.

586
01:13:29,720 --> 01:13:31,084
I came back.

587
01:13:31,522 --> 01:13:34,649
- I thought that's what you wanted.
- Nobody wants you here.

588
01:13:34,858 --> 01:13:36,292
Really?

589
01:13:36,494 --> 01:13:40,431
My parents are right upstairs.
They think you've left.

590
01:13:40,631 --> 01:13:42,292
So, surprise!

591
01:13:42,868 --> 01:13:47,669
- I can call them, I can call my dad.
- But you won't.

592
01:14:03,055 --> 01:14:05,922
You're playing a dangerous
game here.

593
01:14:07,226 --> 01:14:09,786
If you're trying to blackmail me...

594
01:14:10,229 --> 01:14:12,561
it's not gonna work.

595
01:14:13,934 --> 01:14:18,166
You know what I want.
It's not that difficult.

596
01:14:21,008 --> 01:14:22,703
Get out.

597
01:14:24,578 --> 01:14:27,104
Get out before I call my dad.

598
01:14:27,948 --> 01:14:31,316
He trusts you. You're his...

599
01:14:32,253 --> 01:14:34,187
best friend.

600
01:14:37,926 --> 01:14:40,623
This will be the end
of everything.

601
01:14:42,864 --> 01:14:46,459
What about you? What'll
your dad think about you?

602
01:14:47,036 --> 01:14:48,901
Stop.

603
01:14:49,371 --> 01:14:51,305
Stop it.

604
01:14:52,708 --> 01:14:55,405
That's what you said from
the beginning.

605
01:14:56,745 --> 01:15:00,910
If I tell them what happened, they
will arrest you and put you in jail.

606
01:15:07,791 --> 01:15:09,816
So get out of here...

607
01:15:10,027 --> 01:15:11,756
before...

608
01:15:15,032 --> 01:15:17,193
Before what?

609
01:15:34,453 --> 01:15:36,421
Before...

610
01:15:37,022 --> 01:15:39,650
I kill you.

611
01:15:53,539 --> 01:15:56,303
Well, then they'd put you in jail.

612
01:16:04,485 --> 01:16:06,817
I hate you.

613
01:16:07,755 --> 01:16:09,848
I hate us both.

614
01:16:25,340 --> 01:16:27,638
- I'm gonna take her over there.
- Yeah, big time.

615
01:16:31,514 --> 01:16:33,880
Well, there it was.

616
01:16:34,516 --> 01:16:39,216
Yeah, there it was, all right. Baby,
you got a way with you. Really.

617
01:16:40,122 --> 01:16:41,283
Bob?

618
01:16:42,993 --> 01:16:45,518
Very good. Really.

619
01:16:46,063 --> 01:16:51,831
I mean, it was forced maybe,
but still humanistic.

620
01:16:53,970 --> 01:16:56,439
Very good. Really!

621
01:16:56,940 --> 01:16:58,635
Really.

622
01:17:03,815 --> 01:17:08,775
Oh, I thank you, Betty.
And I really mean that, sincerely.

623
01:17:08,986 --> 01:17:10,545
I mean, it was...

624
01:17:10,756 --> 01:17:12,587
extraordinary.

625
01:17:13,058 --> 01:17:14,855
You've done your aunt proud today.

626
01:17:15,060 --> 01:17:18,655
I'm going to tell
her that first chance I get.

627
01:17:18,864 --> 01:17:23,028
Now, you and I are going
to speak again very soon.

628
01:17:23,670 --> 01:17:26,833
- Thank you, Mr. Brown.
- Thank you, Wally.

629
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:30,669
I'm sure you all have a lot to talk
about. We'll walk Betty out.

630
01:17:30,877 --> 01:17:34,176
Yes, indeed.
And it was our pleasure, Lynne.

631
01:17:34,381 --> 01:17:38,613
Don't you be a stranger around here.
We'd love to have you here.

632
01:17:38,818 --> 01:17:41,514
- Come on, Betty.
- Thank you again, Mr. Brown.

633
01:17:41,721 --> 01:17:44,816
And it was nice meeting
all of you.

634
01:17:45,359 --> 01:17:46,518
Bye.

635
01:17:48,095 --> 01:17:49,653
Bye!

636
01:17:53,934 --> 01:17:56,732
She's a slam-dunk! Where
the hell did you find her?

637
01:17:57,339 --> 01:17:59,330
God, that was awful!

638
01:18:00,274 --> 01:18:04,473
Not you, Betty. You were stellar,
and I mean that. But poor Wally.

639
01:18:04,679 --> 01:18:08,809
He'll never get that picture made.
Wally's days were up 2O years ago.

640
01:18:09,017 --> 01:18:11,986
You know Woody Katz
is only doing it for a favor.

641
01:18:12,220 --> 01:18:14,155
And the cast they have
so far is terrible.

642
01:18:14,356 --> 01:18:18,657
Oh, God, terrible!
That poor old fool Wally.

643
01:18:18,861 --> 01:18:22,319
He was very nice
and he seems so sweet.

644
01:18:22,532 --> 01:18:25,058
And Wally... Mr. Brown is a very
close friend of my aunt's.

645
01:18:25,268 --> 01:18:28,238
Don't get me wrong, I love Wally.

646
01:18:28,438 --> 01:18:31,339
I ought to, I was married
to him for 1O years.

647
01:18:31,708 --> 01:18:37,203
And I love actors. All actors.
We just get a little catty sometimes.

648
01:18:37,981 --> 01:18:40,643
We want to take you across and
introduce you to a director...

649
01:18:40,851 --> 01:18:42,513
who's a head above the rest.

650
01:18:42,720 --> 01:18:44,950
He's got a project
you will kill for.

651
01:18:45,290 --> 01:18:47,850
Knock right out of the park!

652
01:18:49,527 --> 01:18:52,223
Sixteen reasons

653
01:18:52,430 --> 01:18:57,926

Of sixteen reasons

666
01:19:42,251 --> 01:19:47,314
Why I love you

667
01:19:48,690 --> 01:19:51,888

Of sixteen reasons

677
01:20:19,523 --> 01:20:24,962

Sixteen reasons

679
01:20:29,534 --> 01:20:34,369
Why I love you

680
01:20:36,309 --> 01:20:40,803
- Cut it! Thank you very much, Carol.
- Checking the gate?

681
01:20:41,013 --> 01:20:43,447
Checking the gate! Thank you.
We'll tell you what happens next!

682
01:20:44,115 --> 01:20:46,607
Thank you very much for coming in.
I know how busy you are.

683
01:20:46,819 --> 01:20:49,583
Are you kidding me? I loved the script.
Just show me where to sign.

684
01:20:49,789 --> 01:20:52,622
I love you, but there's no way they're
gonna let me cast this thing...

685
01:20:52,826 --> 01:20:55,089
until I've seen everyone. I'll let
you know as soon as I can.

686
01:20:55,294 --> 01:20:59,823
I know you will. Because my manager
is gonna be bugging you. And me!

687
01:21:00,033 --> 01:21:02,968
- My pleasure. Now get outta here.
- You're so cruel to me.

688
01:21:03,170 --> 01:21:05,866
- I'm the girl who's playing this part.
- I'll see you later.

689
01:21:07,721 --> 01:21:09,450
Hank? Where's Hank?

690
01:21:09,924 --> 01:21:12,290
- Who's next, Hank?
- Camilla Rhodes.

691
01:21:13,593 --> 01:21:15,892
- Is she ready?
- All ready.

692
01:21:16,764 --> 01:21:19,528
- Bring her in.
- Camilla Rhodes, next.

693
01:21:25,540 --> 01:21:28,999
"Sylvia North Story".
Camilla Rhodes, take one.

694
01:21:29,578 --> 01:21:31,944
Okay, here we go.
Let's lock it up, please.

695
01:21:32,648 --> 01:21:34,912
- Roll sound, please.
- That's fit.

696
01:21:35,118 --> 01:21:36,914
Playback and action.

697
01:21:50,301 --> 01:21:52,564
Why haven't I told you?

698
01:21:52,903 --> 01:21:56,100
Oh, baby, I told

699
01:21:56,306 --> 01:21:58,035
Every little star

700
01:21:58,242 --> 01:22:02,338
Just how sweet I think you are

701
01:22:02,546 --> 01:22:06,642
Why haven't I told you?

702
01:22:07,318 --> 01:22:11,414
- Get Jason over here.
- Cindy, Adam wants to see Jason.

703
01:22:13,625 --> 01:22:17,322
Made my heart an open book

704
01:22:17,963 --> 01:22:22,401
Why haven't I told you?

705
01:22:25,204 --> 01:22:28,799
Friends ask me
Am I in love

706
01:22:29,008 --> 01:22:32,705
I always answer “yes"

707
01:22:32,912 --> 01:22:36,609
Might as well confess

708
01:22:36,816 --> 01:22:40,217
If the answer's yes

709
01:22:40,586 --> 01:22:44,421
Maybe you may love me too

710
01:22:44,625 --> 01:22:48,425
Oh, my darling, if you do

711
01:22:48,862 --> 01:22:52,161
- Why haven't you told me?
- Did you want to tell something?

712
01:23:02,543 --> 01:23:04,568
This is the girl.

713
01:23:09,418 --> 01:23:11,852
Excellent choice, Adam.

714
01:23:22,799 --> 01:23:24,663
Oh, my goodness.

715
01:23:33,877 --> 01:23:35,811
I have to be somewhere.

716
01:23:36,013 --> 01:23:38,207
I promised a friend.

717
01:23:39,049 --> 01:23:42,508
- I'm sorry, I must go.
- Now?

718
01:24:05,912 --> 01:24:07,903
Should be around here.

719
01:24:08,748 --> 01:24:11,012
259O. That's it.

720
01:24:11,384 --> 01:24:14,080
Up there!
Does it look familiar?

721
01:24:22,663 --> 01:24:25,062
- Don't stop!
- What is it? What do you see?

722
01:24:25,432 --> 01:24:28,697
- Those men, in front, in the car.
- Do you know them?

723
01:24:30,037 --> 01:24:32,598
Keep going.
Go around to the back.

724
01:25:19,356 --> 01:25:21,985
Selwyn, number 12.

725
01:25:44,683 --> 01:25:46,981
Now you got me scared.

726
01:26:10,311 --> 01:26:11,641
You see?

727
01:26:11,846 --> 01:26:14,747
I told you there was nothing
to be afraid of.

728
01:27:14,045 --> 01:27:15,376
Betty, wait. Wait!

729
01:27:17,815 --> 01:27:19,249
Don't.

730
01:27:44,644 --> 01:27:47,010
No one's home.

731
01:27:47,214 --> 01:27:48,773
Yes?

732
01:27:50,084 --> 01:27:51,847
Diane?

733
01:27:53,521 --> 01:27:55,546
Number 17.

734
01:27:57,258 --> 01:27:59,692
But it said number 12.

735
01:28:01,395 --> 01:28:03,295
I switched apartments with her.

736
01:28:03,497 --> 01:28:07,195
She's in 17.
It's down at the end, on the left.

737
01:28:11,640 --> 01:28:14,438
But she hasn't been around
for a few days.

738
01:28:16,478 --> 01:28:18,674
We'll leave her a note.

739
01:28:18,881 --> 01:28:20,781
I'll go with you.

740
01:28:22,719 --> 01:28:25,085
She still got some of my stuff.

741
01:28:30,294 --> 01:28:33,091
You go ahead.
I gotta get that.

742
01:28:47,478 --> 01:28:50,971
- Guess you're not Diane Selwyn.
- Guess I'm not.

743
01:29:27,054 --> 01:29:29,682
There's still no one home, I guess.

744
01:29:57,886 --> 01:30:00,378
- What are you doing?
- Come on, help me in.

745
01:30:01,490 --> 01:30:04,016
Come on, I'll open the front door.

746
01:30:04,761 --> 01:30:06,285
No!

747
01:30:10,667 --> 01:30:12,328
Come on.

748
01:30:16,407 --> 01:30:18,238
Come on!

749
01:32:37,824 --> 01:32:40,486
I know what you're doing.

750
01:33:00,181 --> 01:33:02,978
I know what you have to do.

751
01:33:05,053 --> 01:33:07,749
But let me do it.

752
01:33:15,598 --> 01:33:18,362
Let me do it.

753
01:33:39,790 --> 01:33:42,884
You look like someone else.

754
01:34:03,682 --> 01:34:05,513
Good night, Betty.

755
01:34:05,718 --> 01:34:08,380
You don't have to wear
that in the house.

756
01:34:08,721 --> 01:34:10,245
What?

757
01:34:10,456 --> 01:34:12,186
The wig!

758
01:34:12,392 --> 01:34:17,556
I was just looking at myself again.
I'll take it off to sleep.

759
01:34:18,198 --> 01:34:20,564
You don't have
to sleep on that couch.

760
01:34:20,767 --> 01:34:24,760
- No, it's okay.
- No, it's not. This is a huge bed.

761
01:34:25,105 --> 01:34:27,096
Come on, just get in
and get a good night sleep.

762
01:34:57,973 --> 01:35:01,171
It's more comfortable than
the couch, isn't it?

763
01:35:10,019 --> 01:35:12,078
Thank you, Betty.

764
01:35:12,755 --> 01:35:17,284
It's nothing. I shouldn't have let
you sleep on the couch last night.

765
01:35:17,494 --> 01:35:19,223
No, I mean...

766
01:35:19,997 --> 01:35:22,090
thank you for everything.

767
01:35:26,171 --> 01:35:27,728
You're welcome.

768
01:35:37,482 --> 01:35:39,848
Good night, sweet Betty.

769
01:35:49,095 --> 01:35:51,120
Good night.

770
01:36:31,240 --> 01:36:33,800
Have you ever done this before?

771
01:36:35,177 --> 01:36:37,169
I don't know.

772
01:36:37,380 --> 01:36:38,904
Have you?

773
01:36:52,462 --> 01:36:55,260
I want to with you.

774
01:37:19,791 --> 01:37:22,693
I'm in love with you.

775
01:37:36,108 --> 01:37:38,976
I'm in love with you.

776
01:38:04,038 --> 01:38:06,734
Silence.

777
01:38:07,508 --> 01:38:09,772
Silence.

778
01:38:11,146 --> 01:38:13,580
Silence.

779
01:38:14,483 --> 01:38:17,043
There's no band.

780
01:38:17,987 --> 01:38:20,478
There's no band.

781
01:38:21,323 --> 01:38:24,019
There's no orchestra.

782
01:38:25,494 --> 01:38:27,520
Silence!

783
01:38:42,078 --> 01:38:45,014
- Rita?
- There's no band.

784
01:38:45,549 --> 01:38:47,813
Rita, wake up!

785
01:38:51,555 --> 01:38:53,113
It's okay. It's okay.

786
01:38:53,324 --> 01:38:55,259
No, it's not okay.

787
01:38:56,160 --> 01:38:58,425
What's wrong?

788
01:38:59,131 --> 01:39:01,725
Go with me somewhere.

789
01:39:03,101 --> 01:39:06,400
It's two o'clock. It's two
o'clock in the morning.

790
01:39:09,909 --> 01:39:12,810
Go with me somewhere.

791
01:39:13,012 --> 01:39:14,946
Sure.

792
01:39:15,148 --> 01:39:16,581
Now?

793
01:39:18,252 --> 01:39:20,116
Right now.

794
01:40:50,482 --> 01:40:53,383
There's no band!

795
01:40:54,220 --> 01:40:57,189
There is no band!

796
01:41:02,028 --> 01:41:03,859
This is all...

797
01:41:04,464 --> 01:41:06,762
a tape recording.

798
01:41:06,967 --> 01:41:09,800
There's no band, and yet...

799
01:41:10,603 --> 01:41:13,004
we hear a band.

800
01:41:13,507 --> 01:41:16,477
If we want to hear
a clarinet...

801
01:41:17,011 --> 01:41:18,808
listen...

802
01:41:31,927 --> 01:41:34,988
A muted trombone.

803
01:41:48,444 --> 01:41:52,141
A muted trumpet.

804
01:42:09,033 --> 01:42:11,934
It's all recorded.

805
01:42:14,239 --> 01:42:17,072
There's no band!

806
01:42:18,377 --> 01:42:20,241
It is all...

807
01:42:20,813 --> 01:42:23,077
a tape.

808
01:42:34,994 --> 01:42:39,432
It is an illusion.

809
01:42:44,037 --> 01:42:45,800
Listen!

810
01:43:56,214 --> 01:44:02,051
Ladies and gentlemen,
let Club Silencio introduce to you...

811
01:44:02,487 --> 01:44:05,116
"La Llorona de Los Angeles".

812
01:44:05,323 --> 01:44:08,418
Rebekah del Rio.

813
01:44:27,247 --> 01:44:30,547
I was all right

814
01:44:30,751 --> 01:44:33,687
For a while

815
01:44:33,887 --> 01:44:40,123
I could smile for a while

816
01:44:40,328 --> 01:44:43,593
But I saw you last night

817
01:44:43,798 --> 01:44:47,632
You held my hand so tight

818
01:44:47,836 --> 01:44:54,503
As you stopped to say hello

819
01:44:54,910 --> 01:44:59,347
You wished me well and you

820
01:44:59,548 --> 01:45:02,676
Couldn't tell

821
01:45:02,885 --> 01:45:08,347
That I've been crying

822
01:45:08,558 --> 01:45:11,425
Over you

823
01:45:11,628 --> 01:45:14,927
Crying

824
01:45:15,132 --> 01:45:17,622
Over you

825
01:45:18,135 --> 01:45:23,767
Since you said “so long"

826
01:45:24,308 --> 01:45:30,543
I've been miserable and alone

827
01:45:30,949 --> 01:45:34,646
Lonesome and crying

828
01:45:35,152 --> 01:45:37,986
Crying

829
01:45:38,390 --> 01:45:41,588
Crying

830
01:45:41,793 --> 01:45:44,193
Crying

831
01:45:44,397 --> 01:45:50,824
It's hard to understand

832
01:45:51,036 --> 01:45:57,272
That upon seeing you again

833
01:45:57,477 --> 01:46:01,574
I'd be crying

834
01:46:02,281 --> 01:46:05,274
I thought

835
01:46:05,486 --> 01:46:08,455
That I was over you

836
01:46:08,655 --> 01:46:15,323
But it's true, so true

837
01:46:15,530 --> 01:46:18,863
I love you even more

838
01:46:19,067 --> 01:46:22,468
Much more than I did before

839
01:46:22,670 --> 01:46:28,303
But darling, what can I do

840
01:46:28,510 --> 01:46:34,108
You don't love me anymore

841
01:46:34,316 --> 01:46:40,984
And I will always be

842
01:46:41,524 --> 01:46:47,862
Crying over you

843
01:46:48,063 --> 01:46:53,900
Crying over you

844
01:46:54,104 --> 01:47:00,134
Your love has captured

845
01:47:00,343 --> 01:47:05,907
The whole of my heart

846
01:47:06,117 --> 01:47:09,712
That was left crying

847
01:47:09,921 --> 01:47:13,049
Crying

848
01:47:13,257 --> 01:47:16,284
Crying

849
01:47:16,495 --> 01:47:19,794
Crying

850
01:48:37,228 --> 01:48:39,196
Betty?

851
01:48:42,099 --> 01:48:43,760
Betty?

852
01:48:55,347 --> 01:48:58,044
Where are you?

853
01:51:34,483 --> 01:51:36,247
Hey, pretty girl.

854
01:51:37,186 --> 01:51:39,051
Time to wake up.

855
01:53:12,188 --> 01:53:15,122
- Where have you been?
- What do you want?

856
01:53:15,758 --> 01:53:18,591
My lamp and dishes.

857
01:53:20,329 --> 01:53:23,128
Come on, Diane,
it's been three weeks.

858
01:53:25,402 --> 01:53:28,371
I put your dishes in that box.

859
01:53:47,492 --> 01:53:50,984
- That's my ashtray.
- Take it.

860
01:54:02,274 --> 01:54:06,438
- Anytime.
- I'm just making sure, Diane.

861
01:54:15,454 --> 01:54:17,514
This is it?

862
01:54:22,897 --> 01:54:26,298
By the way, those two detectives
came by again looking for you.

863
01:55:18,055 --> 01:55:20,080
Camilla!

864
01:55:22,559 --> 01:55:24,755
You've come back.

865
01:57:02,066 --> 01:57:04,933
What was that you were saying,
beautiful?

866
01:57:05,437 --> 01:57:07,131
I said...

867
01:57:07,571 --> 01:57:10,199
you drive me wild.

868
01:57:22,255 --> 01:57:24,586
We shouldn't do this anymore.

869
01:57:30,696 --> 01:57:32,960
Don't say that.

870
01:57:37,470 --> 01:57:40,269
Don't ever say that.

871
01:57:40,474 --> 01:57:42,305
Don't, Diane!

872
01:57:42,509 --> 01:57:43,908
Stop it!

873
01:57:44,111 --> 01:57:45,703
Diane, stop!

874
01:57:46,814 --> 01:57:49,409
I've tried to tell you this before.

875
01:57:57,559 --> 01:57:59,720
It's him, isn't it?

876
01:58:10,840 --> 01:58:14,003
I'm not trying to show you how
to do the scene, but just...

877
01:58:15,212 --> 01:58:18,113
watch me and I think you'll
understand what I'm getting at.

878
01:58:22,451 --> 01:58:25,614
Don't sit so rigid, just...

879
01:58:25,822 --> 01:58:27,254
just relax.

880
01:58:28,091 --> 01:58:32,050
Now, the two of you are alone
and it's real comfortable.

881
01:58:33,630 --> 01:58:36,156
Like you've known
each other forever.

882
01:58:36,367 --> 01:58:39,530
Even if you don't say anything,
it's real comfortable.

883
01:58:41,172 --> 01:58:44,505
Hank, can you just clear the set?
There's too many people around here.

884
01:58:44,710 --> 01:58:47,474
- Let's get this worked out.
- Clear the set!

885
01:58:47,679 --> 01:58:50,169
Everyone have a cup of coffee.

886
01:58:51,182 --> 01:58:54,311
- Everyone, please!
- Can Diane stay?

887
01:58:54,519 --> 01:58:57,920
Yeah, sure, Diane can stay.
Hank, let Diane stay!

888
01:58:58,123 --> 01:58:59,852
Diane!

889
01:59:05,030 --> 01:59:08,261
Now, when she starts to cry,
don't pull her towards you.

890
01:59:10,303 --> 01:59:14,934
Let her fall into you.
Just let her fall.

891
01:59:18,746 --> 01:59:20,714
And when you kiss her...

892
01:59:22,216 --> 01:59:25,082
it's just a continuation
of that move.

893
01:59:27,354 --> 01:59:29,379
There's no break.

894
01:59:53,282 --> 01:59:55,409
Kill the lights!

895
02:00:05,361 --> 02:00:08,024
Don't be mad.
Don't make it be like this.

896
02:00:08,231 --> 02:00:11,723
Oh, sure, you want me to make
this easy for you.

897
02:00:11,935 --> 02:00:14,665
No fucking way!
It's not gonna be!

898
02:00:15,406 --> 02:00:17,840
- It's not easy for me!
- Diane!

899
02:01:38,528 --> 02:01:41,656
Hello, it's me.
Leave a message.

900
02:01:44,267 --> 02:01:45,928
Diane?

901
02:01:50,274 --> 02:01:53,072
- Hello?
- Diane?

902
02:01:54,611 --> 02:01:55,976
Camilla.

903
02:01:56,180 --> 02:01:59,911
Diane, the car's waiting.
Are you okay?

904
02:02:00,818 --> 02:02:02,979
You coming?

905
02:02:08,226 --> 02:02:12,322
Good. It means so much to me.

906
02:02:13,031 --> 02:02:16,523
Go on. The car's right
outside your house.

907
02:02:16,936 --> 02:02:19,598
It's been waiting, okay?

908
02:02:23,709 --> 02:02:25,438
Okay.

909
02:02:25,644 --> 02:02:29,445
It's 698O, Mulholland Drive.

910
02:02:30,349 --> 02:02:32,443
Mulholland Drive.

911
02:03:39,023 --> 02:03:42,254
What are you doing?
We don't stop here.

912
02:03:46,932 --> 02:03:48,900
A surprise.

913
02:04:10,890 --> 02:04:12,654
Shortcut.

914
02:04:15,127 --> 02:04:17,528
Come on, sweetheart.

915
02:04:22,636 --> 02:04:24,501
It's beautiful.

916
02:04:24,705 --> 02:04:26,935
A secret path.

917
02:05:31,876 --> 02:05:33,970
Perfect timing.

918
02:05:34,646 --> 02:05:36,705
Welcome, Diane.

919
02:05:42,088 --> 02:05:45,488
Well...
Here's to love.

920
02:05:55,601 --> 02:05:58,331
Here's to love.

921
02:06:02,910 --> 02:06:04,969
Here she is!

922
02:06:13,187 --> 02:06:15,918
I don't believe
you met my mother.

923
02:06:16,591 --> 02:06:18,922
Hi. I'm Diane Selwyn.

924
02:06:19,127 --> 02:06:22,654
Just call me Coco, everybody
does. Pleased to meet you.

925
02:06:23,031 --> 02:06:25,830
Well, let's eat!
I'm starving!

926
02:06:31,906 --> 02:06:33,932
I'm sorry I was late.

927
02:06:53,530 --> 02:06:56,056
I'm from Deep River, Ontario.

928
02:06:56,600 --> 02:07:00,229
- A small town.
- So you rolled in here from Canada.

929
02:07:02,973 --> 02:07:05,636
I always wanted to come here.

930
02:07:06,411 --> 02:07:09,471
I won this jitterbug contest.

931
02:07:10,148 --> 02:07:13,175
That sort of led to acting.

932
02:07:13,751 --> 02:07:17,017
You know, wanting to act.

933
02:07:17,689 --> 02:07:20,055
When my aunt died...

934
02:07:21,193 --> 02:07:24,026
Anyway, she left me some money.

935
02:07:24,731 --> 02:07:27,324
- She worked here.
- In the movies?

936
02:07:28,400 --> 02:07:29,731
Yes.

937
02:07:31,136 --> 02:07:33,367
How did you meet Camilla?

938
02:07:35,074 --> 02:07:38,771
- On the "Sylvia North Story".
- Camilla was great in that.

939
02:07:38,979 --> 02:07:41,812
I never went to
Casablanca with Luigi.

940
02:07:42,015 --> 02:07:44,540
- What a pity!
- Then go!

941
02:07:53,762 --> 02:07:56,559
I wanted the lead so bad.

942
02:07:57,933 --> 02:08:01,197
Anyway, Camilla got the part.

943
02:08:04,206 --> 02:08:06,071
The director...

944
02:08:06,274 --> 02:08:08,139
Bob Rooker?

945
02:08:08,343 --> 02:08:10,038
Yes.

946
02:08:12,482 --> 02:08:15,178
He didn't think so much of me.

947
02:08:19,188 --> 02:08:21,918
Anyway, that's when
we became friends.

948
02:08:23,427 --> 02:08:24,916
She helped me...

949
02:08:25,428 --> 02:08:28,397
getting some parts in some
of her films.

950
02:08:30,634 --> 02:08:32,602
I see.

951
02:08:46,851 --> 02:08:50,844
So I got the pool,
and she got the pool man.

952
02:08:53,124 --> 02:08:56,890
I couldn't believe it. I wanted
to buy that judge a Rolls Royce.

953
02:09:03,235 --> 02:09:05,897
Sometimes, good things happen.

954
02:09:57,393 --> 02:10:00,021
So I guess we've saved
the best for last.

955
02:10:03,333 --> 02:10:06,598
- Do you want to tell them?
- No, you tell them.

956
02:10:10,206 --> 02:10:12,539
Camilla and I...

957
02:10:24,188 --> 02:10:25,918
are going to be...

958
02:10:38,004 --> 02:10:39,972
Sorry about that.

959
02:10:47,146 --> 02:10:49,171
No, I'm fine.

960
02:10:54,654 --> 02:10:57,123
This is the girl.

961
02:10:58,090 --> 02:11:00,889
Don't show me this
fucking thing here.

962
02:11:01,561 --> 02:11:04,689
It's just an actress' photo
resume. Everybody's got one.

963
02:11:06,233 --> 02:11:08,565
You got the money?

964
02:11:08,770 --> 02:11:10,761
I sure do.

965
02:11:21,517 --> 02:11:25,078
Okay, now, once you hand that over
to me, it's a done deal.

966
02:11:28,390 --> 02:11:30,824
You sure you want this?

967
02:11:35,464 --> 02:11:38,263
More than anything in this world.

968
02:11:48,411 --> 02:11:51,346
When it's finished, you'll find
this where I told you.

969
02:12:04,562 --> 02:12:07,258
What's it open?

970
02:16:21,152 --> 02:16:23,552
Silencio.
