1
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,574
What are you doing?
We don't stop here.

2
00:05:31,683 --> 00:05:33,935
Get out of the car.

3
00:09:13,795 --> 00:09:18,765
The boys found this on the floor,
in the back of the Caddy.

4
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:21,550
Yeah, they showed me.

5
00:09:23,502 --> 00:09:25,935
Could be unrelated.

6
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:27,951
Could be.

7
00:09:28,514 --> 00:09:31,704
Any of those dead kids
wearing pearl earrings?

8
00:09:31,923 --> 00:09:33,726
No.

9
00:09:34,636 --> 00:09:38,111
Could be someone's missing, maybe.

10
00:09:39,194 --> 00:09:41,376
That’s what I'm thinking.

11
00:10:18,893 --> 00:10:21,598
Just one more bag after that.

12
00:12:07,304 --> 00:12:09,213
I just wanted to come here.

13
00:12:10,783 --> 00:12:12,728
To Winkie's?

14
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:14,982
This Winkie's.

15
00:12:16,003 --> 00:12:19,752
Okay. Why this Winkie's?

16
00:12:23,657 --> 00:12:25,602
It’s kind of embarrassing.

17
00:12:28,459 --> 00:12:30,297
Go ahead.

18
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:35,169
- I had a dream about this place.
- Oh, boy.

19
00:12:35,452 --> 00:12:37,184
See what I mean?

20
00:12:38,827 --> 00:12:42,931
Okay, so you had a dream
about this place.

21
00:12:44,428 --> 00:12:46,338
Tell me.

22
00:12:49,682 --> 00:12:51,377
Well...

23
00:12:53,021 --> 00:12:57,126
it’s the second one I've had.
But they're both the same.

24
00:12:59,006 --> 00:13:02,788
They start out that I'm in here but...

25
00:13:03,076 --> 00:13:05,578
it’s not day or night...

26
00:13:06,172 --> 00:13:08,461
it’s kind of half-night, you know?

27
00:13:08,852 --> 00:13:11,593
But it looks just like this.

28
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:13,826
Except for the light.

29
00:13:15,079 --> 00:13:18,270
And I'm scared like I can't
tell you.

30
00:13:20,334 --> 00:13:22,279
Of all people...

31
00:13:22,526 --> 00:13:25,099
you're standing right over there.

32
00:13:28,998 --> 00:13:31,145
By that counter.

33
00:13:33,068 --> 00:13:36,509
You're in both dreams
and you're scared.

34
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:42,146
I get even more frightened when
I see how afraid you are, and...

35
00:13:46,114 --> 00:13:48,747
then I realize what it is.

36
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:54,666
There's a man...

37
00:13:55,404 --> 00:13:57,692
in back of this place.

38
00:14:00,032 --> 00:14:02,357
He's the one who's doing it.

39
00:14:04,068 --> 00:14:06,914
I can see him through the wall.

40
00:14:07,129 --> 00:14:09,311
I can see his face.

41
00:14:15,132 --> 00:14:20,172
I hope that I never see that face
ever outside of the dream.

42
00:14:30,372 --> 00:14:32,423
That’s it.

43
00:14:32,806 --> 00:14:36,804
So... you came to see
if he's out there.

44
00:14:40,253 --> 00:14:43,134
To get rid of this
god-awful feeling.

45
00:14:46,444 --> 00:14:48,176
Right then.

46
00:15:35,258 --> 00:15:37,061
It’s around the back.

47
00:16:45,782 --> 00:16:49,328
Dan! Dan, are you all right?

48
00:16:49,539 --> 00:16:52,386
What is it, Dan? Dan?

49
00:17:17,932 --> 00:17:18,962
Hello?

50
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:24,048
The girl is still missing.

51
00:17:45,033 --> 00:17:48,224
- Talk to me.
- The same.

52
00:18:26,436 --> 00:18:28,452
I can't believe it.

53
00:18:58,828 --> 00:19:01,947
Well, it's time to say
good-bye, Betty.

54
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:05,503
- It’s been so nice traveling with you.
- Thank you, Irene.

55
00:19:05,718 --> 00:19:09,323
I was so excited and nervous. It was
sure great to have you to talk to.

56
00:19:09,682 --> 00:19:13,954
- I'll watch for you on the big screen.
- Okay, Irene.

57
00:19:14,172 --> 00:19:16,116
Won't that be the day?

58
00:19:16,328 --> 00:19:18,581
Good luck, Betty dear.

59
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:22,960
- Take care of yourself and be careful.
- I will.

60
00:19:23,181 --> 00:19:25,198
Thanks, again.

61
00:19:25,407 --> 00:19:28,398
Betty, it was so nice meeting you.
All the luck in the world.

62
00:19:28,609 --> 00:19:30,199
Thank you.

63
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:42,549
- My bags?
- Where to?

64
00:19:44,022 --> 00:19:45,895
1612, Hayvenhurst.

65
00:19:48,719 --> 00:19:50,250
Got it.

66
00:21:08,011 --> 00:21:12,568
- Ten bucks says you're Betty.
- Yes, I am, Mrs. Lenoix.

67
00:21:12,779 --> 00:21:16,811
- It is Mrs. Lenoix, isn't it?
- In all my living glory, baby.

68
00:21:17,614 --> 00:21:21,885
- Pleased to meet you.
- Call me Coco. Everybody else does.

69
00:21:22,102 --> 00:21:25,435
- Wait there and I'll go get the key.
- Okay, Coco.

70
00:21:30,068 --> 00:21:31,871
Wilkins!

71
00:21:32,087 --> 00:21:33,118
Wilkins!

72
00:21:33,339 --> 00:21:36,815
If that damn dog craps
in the courtyard one more time...

73
00:21:37,028 --> 00:21:41,928
I'm just gonna bank his little butt for
breakfast! You don't have any pets?

74
00:21:42,143 --> 00:21:43,839
- No, I don't.
- They're allowed.

75
00:21:44,056 --> 00:21:47,010
I just don't like them
in here for obvious reasons.

76
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:51,706
There was a man that lived here once
that had a prizefighting kangaroo.

77
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:57,304
You just wouldn't believe what that
kangaroo did to this courtyard.

78
00:21:58,181 --> 00:22:01,478
Let’s go see your aunt’s apartment.
It’s a good one.

79
00:22:01,694 --> 00:22:03,640
I can hardly wait.

80
00:22:11,018 --> 00:22:15,053
- It’s unbelievable!
- I told you.

81
00:22:16,204 --> 00:22:20,547
You and your aunt probably have
an understanding, so here's the key.

82
00:22:20,762 --> 00:22:23,228
And if you need anything,
just give a holler.

83
00:22:23,439 --> 00:22:26,916
Everybody in this building is pretty
much okay with me...

84
00:22:27,129 --> 00:22:29,417
or they wouldn't be here.

85
00:22:29,739 --> 00:22:32,929
If you like, later on
I'll introduce you around.

86
00:22:33,148 --> 00:22:35,745
Well, no hard feelings if you don't.

87
00:24:01,658 --> 00:24:05,656
I'm sorry. My aunt Ruth didn't tell
me someone was gonna be here.

88
00:24:05,869 --> 00:24:08,406
- I'm so sorry.
- It’s okay.

89
00:24:08,896 --> 00:24:14,281
I'm Ruth's niece. My name is Betty.
I'm sure she told you I was coming.

90
00:24:14,949 --> 00:24:18,913
There was an accident.
I came here.

91
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:21,664
I understand. I saw the dress.

92
00:24:22,221 --> 00:24:24,690
I'm sorry. Are you all right?

93
00:24:25,667 --> 00:24:27,505
What happened?

94
00:24:28,798 --> 00:24:30,565
A car...

95
00:24:31,512 --> 00:24:33,587
a car accident.

96
00:24:35,685 --> 00:24:37,630
Are you okay?

97
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:41,979
I think so.

98
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:44,617
I was just...

99
00:24:45,149 --> 00:24:46,916
taking a shower.

100
00:24:47,132 --> 00:24:50,811
Oh, my God, I'm sorry.
I'll let you get back to that.

101
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:53,390
I'm gonna get unpacked.

102
00:24:57,292 --> 00:24:59,201
What’s your name?

103
00:25:03,171 --> 00:25:06,850
I'm sorry, I'll get out of here.
We can talk later.

104
00:25:44,262 --> 00:25:45,792
My name is...

105
00:25:46,418 --> 00:25:47,948
Rita.

106
00:25:50,524 --> 00:25:52,600
Do you work with my aunt?

107
00:25:53,098 --> 00:25:56,881
- No, I...
- I'm sorry...

108
00:25:57,168 --> 00:25:59,316
it 's none of my business.

109
00:26:03,014 --> 00:26:04,957
She has pretty red hair.

110
00:26:05,552 --> 00:26:07,534
She's letting me stay here while
she's working on a movie...

111
00:26:07,745 --> 00:26:12,822
that 's being made in Canada,
but I guess you already know that.

112
00:26:13,034 --> 00:26:15,360
I couldn't afford a place like this
in a million years.

113
00:26:16,027 --> 00:26:19,502
Unless, of course, I'm discovered
and become a movie star.

114
00:26:19,714 --> 00:26:22,704
Of course, I'd rather be known as
a great actress than a movie star...

115
00:26:22,916 --> 00:26:26,142
but sometimes people
end up being both. So...

116
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:29,729
that is, I guess you'd say,
the story of why I came here.

117
00:26:33,528 --> 00:26:37,134
I'm sorry. I'm just
so excited to be here.

118
00:26:37,356 --> 00:26:41,839
I just came here from Deep River,
Ontario, and now I'm in this...

119
00:26:42,608 --> 00:26:46,773
dream place!
Well, you can imagine how I feel.

120
00:26:55,135 --> 00:26:56,628
Sit down.

121
00:27:00,944 --> 00:27:03,020
Where were you hurt?

122
00:27:05,432 --> 00:27:07,377
- We should call a doctor.
- No.

123
00:27:07,589 --> 00:27:12,215
- But this could be serious.
- No, I need to sleep.

124
00:27:12,425 --> 00:27:14,643
If you have a concussion,
you shouldn't sleep.

125
00:27:14,861 --> 00:27:17,222
I'll be okay if I sleep.

126
00:27:17,436 --> 00:27:20,982
I just need to lie down
here and sleep.

127
00:28:18,357 --> 00:28:22,212
You see, Adam, there
are some suggestions...

128
00:28:22,428 --> 00:28:24,337
that ought to be brought forward.

129
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:27,574
And I know you said you would
entertain suggestions.

130
00:28:27,784 --> 00:28:30,879
And that 's all anybody
here is asking you to do.

131
00:28:31,924 --> 00:28:35,852
- What are you talking about?
- An open mind.

132
00:28:36,761 --> 00:28:41,447
You're in the process of recasting
your lead actress, and I'm...

133
00:28:42,641 --> 00:28:46,426
we are asking you to keep
an open mind.

134
00:28:56,871 --> 00:28:58,948
What was it the last time?

135
00:29:00,873 --> 00:29:06,080
- Okay, lets try the next one.
- He's not gonna like it.

136
00:29:06,821 --> 00:29:08,375
We'll see.

137
00:29:16,181 --> 00:29:19,584
Castigliani brothers!
Let me introduce you around.

138
00:29:21,329 --> 00:29:23,168
Please...

139
00:29:23,731 --> 00:29:26,956
take a seat. This is Mr. Darby,
whom you know.

140
00:29:27,174 --> 00:29:30,437
And this is the director,
Adam Kesher.

141
00:29:30,655 --> 00:29:34,260
And his manager,
Robert Smith.

142
00:30:08,824 --> 00:30:10,934
She's very pretty.

143
00:30:12,336 --> 00:30:15,705
May I offer you gentlemen anything?

144
00:30:17,973 --> 00:30:20,606
- Espresso.
- Nothing.

145
00:30:20,861 --> 00:30:24,159
- What 's the photo for?
- One espresso.

146
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,876
No, that 's it.

147
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:30,385
I think you're going to enjoy
your espresso this time.

148
00:30:30,775 --> 00:30:32,851
I've done quite a bit of research...

149
00:30:33,071 --> 00:30:34,601
knowing how hard
you are to please.

150
00:30:34,811 --> 00:30:36,828
This one comes
highly recommended.

151
00:30:37,108 --> 00:30:41,212
- What 's the photo for?
- It 's a recommendation.

152
00:30:42,222 --> 00:30:45,032
A recommendation to you, Adam.

153
00:30:46,535 --> 00:30:49,656
- It 's not a recommendation.
- This is the girl.

154
00:30:50,364 --> 00:30:54,255
What girl? For what?
What is this, Ray?

155
00:30:54,782 --> 00:30:58,781
We'd be happy to put her on the
list for considerations.

156
00:30:58,994 --> 00:31:03,407
You'd be pleased to know, there's
quite a bit of interest in this role.

157
00:31:04,281 --> 00:31:08,763
Interest? There's six of the top
actresses that want this thing.

158
00:31:09,638 --> 00:31:11,263
This is the girl.

159
00:31:11,866 --> 00:31:14,641
- Ray, take care of this.
- Hold on, hold on, Adam.

160
00:31:14,858 --> 00:31:16,139
Hold on?

161
00:31:16,355 --> 00:31:18,926
There's no way!
There's no way!

162
00:31:34,027 --> 00:31:35,973
Napkin.

163
00:31:36,985 --> 00:31:38,610
Pardon?

164
00:31:38,829 --> 00:31:40,322
Napkin.

165
00:31:40,847 --> 00:31:42,755
Of course.

166
00:31:43,281 --> 00:31:44,834
Excuse me.

167
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:03,594
Is that all, sir?

168
00:33:01,008 --> 00:33:04,343
- Shit.
- Sorry. That was highly recommended.

169
00:33:04,558 --> 00:33:07,155
That is considered one of the finest
espressos in the world!

170
00:33:07,376 --> 00:33:10,887
What 's going on here? There is
no way that girl is in my movie!

171
00:33:15,169 --> 00:33:19,583
- This is the girl.
- Hey, that girl is not in my film!

172
00:33:22,544 --> 00:33:24,834
It 's no longer your film.

173
00:33:30,129 --> 00:33:31,896
This is the girl.

174
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:13,929
Castigliani brothers get out
of that limo?

175
00:34:14,595 --> 00:34:16,398
- The two guys in dark suits?
- Yeah.

176
00:34:16,612 --> 00:34:19,458
- Yes.
- Leave that door open.

177
00:34:29,659 --> 00:34:31,391
Castigliani brothers?

178
00:34:31,607 --> 00:34:33,373
Beat it, pal.

179
00:35:18,194 --> 00:35:19,926
Good afternoon, Mr. Roque.

180
00:35:22,266 --> 00:35:25,490
Her name is Camilla Rhodes.

181
00:35:26,543 --> 00:35:28,904
The director doesn't want her.

182
00:35:32,494 --> 00:35:35,068
Do you want him replaced?

183
00:35:37,921 --> 00:35:39,830
I know they said...

184
00:35:42,096 --> 00:35:43,756
Then?

185
00:35:44,462 --> 00:35:45,993
Then...

186
00:35:46,968 --> 00:35:49,399
that means we should...?

187
00:35:52,498 --> 00:35:54,029
Yes?

188
00:35:55,701 --> 00:35:59,448
Shut everything down?
Is that something that...

189
00:36:01,858 --> 00:36:05,748
Do you want us to shut
everything down?

190
00:36:11,147 --> 00:36:14,172
Then we'll shut everything down.

191
00:36:43,436 --> 00:36:47,149
Oh, man, that 's unheard of.

192
00:36:47,367 --> 00:36:50,559
An accident like that, who could
have foreseen that, man?

193
00:36:53,281 --> 00:36:56,127
- It 's unreal, right?
- Yeah.

194
00:36:57,421 --> 00:36:59,533
Unbelievable, man.

195
00:37:06,016 --> 00:37:08,554
So, bro? God, you look good.

196
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:12,101
- What have you been doing?
- You know, just...

197
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:13,973
doing some stuff
for this guy.

198
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:17,106
Are you making ends meet?

199
00:37:17,322 --> 00:37:18,982
Hardly.

200
00:37:20,837 --> 00:37:24,313
I know, man, look at my digs.

201
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:28,171
Times are tough, bro.

202
00:37:29,153 --> 00:37:32,415
Hey... man, it 's not that bad.

203
00:37:33,572 --> 00:37:36,169
I hope you're not gonna
get in any trouble.

204
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:39,378
That was just a thing, man.
That story? That made you laugh!

205
00:37:39,624 --> 00:37:43,932
- That was a funny story, man.
- Fucking car accident!

206
00:37:46,688 --> 00:37:49,391
Hey, so that 's... that 's it, huh?

207
00:37:49,609 --> 00:37:52,042
That 's Ed's famous black book.

208
00:37:55,142 --> 00:37:57,644
The history of the world...

209
00:37:58,134 --> 00:37:59,938
in phone numbers.

210
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:31,494
Oh, man!

211
00:38:44,199 --> 00:38:46,904
Something bit me bad!

212
00:39:36,806 --> 00:39:38,122
Hey, man!

213
00:39:38,337 --> 00:39:41,942
She's hurt real bad! Could you come
here and call on the phone, please?

214
00:39:42,964 --> 00:39:46,510
She's hurt real bad! You gotta
come in here and call the hospital!

215
00:39:47,834 --> 00:39:52,353
Come on, man! I'm serious about this!
I can't do everything by myself!

216
00:40:12,988 --> 00:40:14,376
Hey, man.

217
00:40:55,957 --> 00:40:57,654
Oh, man!

218
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:19,509
Aunt Ruth, I'll try. I'm gonna study
those lines until I know them...

219
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,902
inside out.

220
00:41:22,121 --> 00:41:25,242
Either right here on
this fabulous leather couch...

221
00:41:25,462 --> 00:41:27,265
or I'll take them with
a coffee into the courtyard...

222
00:41:27,479 --> 00:41:29,662
like a regular movie star.

223
00:41:30,157 --> 00:41:32,731
I got a real shock to find your
friend Rita here.

224
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:35,965
She was in the shower
and I opened the door!

225
00:41:36,245 --> 00:41:38,049
Rita!

226
00:41:38,577 --> 00:41:40,274
What do you mean?

227
00:41:41,292 --> 00:41:43,403
She was in an accident.

228
00:41:44,631 --> 00:41:47,265
Rita. Your friend.

229
00:41:48,877 --> 00:41:51,450
No, Coco unlocked the door.

230
00:41:52,878 --> 00:41:55,132
No, she didn't see her.

231
00:41:56,113 --> 00:41:58,224
She's sleeping.

232
00:41:59,208 --> 00:42:03,373
I'm sure there's some explanation for
this. I don't think we have to do that.

233
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:10,054
Please, don't worry. Aunt Ruth,
we don't need the police.

234
00:42:23,633 --> 00:42:25,437
You're awake.

235
00:42:29,304 --> 00:42:31,107
I think I misunderstood.

236
00:42:31,496 --> 00:42:34,759
I thought you knew my aunt
and that 's why you were here.

237
00:42:35,290 --> 00:42:38,408
I just talked to my aunt on the phone
and she wants me to call the police.

238
00:42:45,134 --> 00:42:46,831
Rita?

239
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:52,502
I'm sorry, I...

240
00:42:52,998 --> 00:42:55,014
What is it, Rita?

241
00:42:58,462 --> 00:43:03,253
I thought when I woke up...
I thought sleep would do it.

242
00:43:04,098 --> 00:43:06,150
What 's wrong?

243
00:43:08,064 --> 00:43:10,425
I just don't know who I am.

244
00:43:10,987 --> 00:43:14,142
- What do you mean? You're Rita.
- No, I'm not.

245
00:43:15,091 --> 00:43:17,559
I don't know what my name is.

246
00:43:17,770 --> 00:43:20,025
I don't know who I am.

247
00:43:30,434 --> 00:43:34,254
This is your purse.
Your name must be in your purse.

248
00:43:36,279 --> 00:43:38,462
You wanna know, don't you?

249
00:43:39,585 --> 00:43:41,766
- Yes, but...
- Open it.

250
00:45:16,829 --> 00:45:20,020
- Sure you don't want anything?
- Not here.

251
00:45:20,239 --> 00:45:22,078
- Thanks.
- A drink or something?

252
00:45:22,293 --> 00:45:24,581
No. Thanks, though.

253
00:45:25,283 --> 00:45:28,164
I'll take a cigarette,
if you have one.

254
00:45:31,058 --> 00:45:33,633
Yeah, just reach inside my
shirt pocket there.

255
00:45:38,469 --> 00:45:41,280
Any new girls on the street lately?

256
00:45:43,097 --> 00:45:44,449
No.

257
00:45:45,045 --> 00:45:47,334
I haven't seen any.

258
00:45:48,699 --> 00:45:50,775
A brunette?

259
00:45:50,995 --> 00:45:53,627
Maybe a little beat-up?

260
00:45:53,847 --> 00:45:55,342
No.

261
00:45:59,381 --> 00:46:02,963
- Keep your eyes open for me, okay?
- Sure.

262
00:46:04,007 --> 00:46:05,288
You bet you will.

263
00:46:08,323 --> 00:46:10,434
That money...

264
00:46:12,463 --> 00:46:15,380
you don't know where it came from?

265
00:46:17,890 --> 00:46:22,233
When you think of them,
the money and the key...

266
00:46:24,222 --> 00:46:27,211
does it make you
remember anything?

267
00:46:29,233 --> 00:46:32,079
There's something...

268
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:35,314
something...

269
00:46:35,530 --> 00:46:38,306
there.

270
00:46:48,402 --> 00:46:49,932
What did you say?

271
00:46:50,142 --> 00:46:53,726
- They fired everyone.
- Who fired everyone?

272
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:58,385
Ray did!
Wait! I'm talking on the phone.

273
00:46:58,805 --> 00:47:03,883
They closed the set. Everybody's
gone. You'd better get down here.

274
00:47:05,138 --> 00:47:06,727
No.

275
00:47:06,948 --> 00:47:09,521
You've gotta talk to Ray.
You've gotta fix this.

276
00:47:09,730 --> 00:47:11,320
I'm going home.

277
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:12,820
Home?

278
00:47:13,036 --> 00:47:16,678
Meet me at the office, we gotta do
something. You gotta do something!

279
00:47:16,899 --> 00:47:21,133
- I'm going home, Cynthia.
- Adam, this isn't like you.

280
00:47:21,351 --> 00:47:24,304
Please, come to the office. There's
gotta be something we can do!

281
00:47:24,517 --> 00:47:26,461
I'm going home.

282
00:47:36,659 --> 00:47:39,329
I wonder where you were going.

283
00:47:43,722 --> 00:47:45,774
Mulholland Drive.

284
00:47:50,855 --> 00:47:52,657
Mulholland Drive?

285
00:47:54,961 --> 00:47:57,072
That 's where I was going.

286
00:47:57,778 --> 00:48:00,210
Mulholland Drive.

287
00:48:01,432 --> 00:48:04,621
Maybe that 's where
the accident was.

288
00:48:05,327 --> 00:48:08,518
There must be a police report.
We could call.

289
00:48:09,224 --> 00:48:13,294
We could call anonymously just
to see if there was an accident.

290
00:48:14,270 --> 00:48:19,655
It'll be just like in the movies!
We'll pretend to be someone else.

291
00:48:21,263 --> 00:48:23,244
I wanna walk around, anyway.

292
00:48:23,455 --> 00:48:26,196
I'm in Hollywood and
I haven't even seen any of it.

293
00:48:26,692 --> 00:48:29,607
Come on, Rita,
do you feel up to it?

294
00:48:37,199 --> 00:48:38,823
Okay.

295
00:48:39,042 --> 00:48:41,330
But just...

296
00:48:43,216 --> 00:48:45,577
just to see.

297
00:48:45,791 --> 00:48:49,646
Just to see if there was
an accident...

298
00:48:50,036 --> 00:48:52,669
on Mulholland Drive.

299
00:49:35,127 --> 00:49:36,931
Lorraine?

300
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:40,407
You're home?

301
00:49:43,339 --> 00:49:45,321
Lorraine?

302
00:50:05,396 --> 00:50:07,306
Now you've done it!

303
00:50:09,675 --> 00:50:12,972
Just forget you ever saw it.
It 's better that way.

304
00:50:16,252 --> 00:50:18,789
What the hell are you
even doing here?

305
00:50:30,830 --> 00:50:33,191
What are you doing?

306
00:50:36,502 --> 00:50:38,790
That 's my jewelry!

307
00:50:55,567 --> 00:51:00,502
- That bastard. You bastard!
- He's probably upset, Lorraine.

308
00:51:07,082 --> 00:51:09,098
What are you doing?

309
00:51:10,875 --> 00:51:12,429
Stop it!

310
00:51:12,650 --> 00:51:14,002
Stop it!

311
00:51:14,389 --> 00:51:16,262
Adam, stop it!

312
00:51:17,103 --> 00:51:18,762
Stop it!

313
00:51:19,155 --> 00:51:20,507
Stop it!

314
00:51:24,547 --> 00:51:27,145
You're hurting me! Gene!

315
00:51:27,366 --> 00:51:29,311
You're hurting me!

316
00:51:32,690 --> 00:51:36,131
That ain't no way to treat your
wife. I don't care what she's done.

317
00:51:37,526 --> 00:51:39,744
Throw him out!

318
00:51:40,205 --> 00:51:41,902
Throw him out!

319
00:51:42,711 --> 00:51:44,727
Damn you, Adam!

320
00:51:45,319 --> 00:51:47,087
Throw him out!

321
00:51:53,461 --> 00:51:55,121
Get out!

322
00:52:34,550 --> 00:52:36,627
Let 's hide it.

323
00:53:21,798 --> 00:53:23,875
There's one.

324
00:53:39,856 --> 00:53:42,631
- Los Angeles Police Department.
- I'm inquiring about an accident...

325
00:53:42,848 --> 00:53:47,227
...last night on Mulholland Drive.
- I'll connect you to Traffic.

326
00:53:49,738 --> 00:53:52,763
- Sergeant Baker.
- Hi, I'm inquiring...

327
00:53:54,850 --> 00:53:59,299
I heard a sound last night that
sounded sort of like a car crash.

328
00:53:59,513 --> 00:54:02,326
I want to know if there was an
accident on Mulholland Drive.

329
00:54:02,539 --> 00:54:04,592
Yes, there was.

330
00:54:04,801 --> 00:54:07,718
- Can you tell me what happened?
- No, I can't.

331
00:54:07,931 --> 00:54:10,673
- Was anyone hurt?
- May I have your name, please?

332
00:54:17,502 --> 00:54:19,684
There was an accident.

333
00:54:19,902 --> 00:54:23,542
He wouldn't tell me anything else,
but that was your accident, Rita.

334
00:54:25,330 --> 00:54:27,761
Maybe there's something
about it in the papers.

335
00:54:28,113 --> 00:54:30,295
Come on, I'll buy you a cup of
coffee and we can see.

336
00:54:34,513 --> 00:54:38,095
Maybe it happened so late it 's
not in today's paper.

337
00:54:38,305 --> 00:54:40,523
There's nothing?

338
00:54:41,716 --> 00:54:44,076
Not that I can see.

339
00:54:45,718 --> 00:54:47,140
That 's okay.

340
00:54:51,841 --> 00:54:53,644
Thanks.

341
00:54:55,285 --> 00:54:57,053
Diane.

342
00:55:01,617 --> 00:55:04,321
Will that be all?
Would you like your check?

343
00:55:05,062 --> 00:55:07,138
Rita, you want something?

344
00:55:09,237 --> 00:55:13,649
- No, just... just the coffee.
- We'll take our check.

345
00:55:20,996 --> 00:55:23,072
What is it, Rita?

346
00:55:31,051 --> 00:55:35,499
I remember something.
I remember something!

347
00:55:38,531 --> 00:55:41,971
- What is it?
- Diane Selwyn.

348
00:55:42,185 --> 00:55:44,581
Maybe that 's my name!

349
00:55:50,047 --> 00:55:53,109
"D. Selwyn." It 's the only one.

350
00:55:54,085 --> 00:55:55,780
I'm gonna call.

351
00:56:03,409 --> 00:56:07,513
- It is strange to be calling yourself.
- Maybe it 's not me.

352
00:56:16,528 --> 00:56:18,186
Hello, it's me.

353
00:56:18,404 --> 00:56:20,480
Leave a message.

354
00:56:22,649 --> 00:56:24,726
That 's not my voice.

355
00:56:26,129 --> 00:56:28,798
But I know her!

356
00:56:30,199 --> 00:56:35,893
Maybe that isn't Diane Selwyn's
voice. Maybe that 's your roommate.

357
00:56:36,113 --> 00:56:40,419
Or if it is Diane Selwyn,
she could tell you who you are.

358
00:56:41,749 --> 00:56:43,693
Maybe.

359
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:46,298
Maybe, maybe...

360
00:57:20,405 --> 00:57:22,243
Adam Kesher?

361
00:57:25,727 --> 00:57:28,300
- Adam Kesher?
- Get lost!

362
00:57:28,510 --> 00:57:31,013
- This is Adam Kesher's house.
- Like hell it is! Get out now!

363
00:57:31,224 --> 00:57:32,469
Get out!

364
00:57:34,670 --> 00:57:36,364
Adam Kesher?

365
00:57:41,627 --> 00:57:45,305
Get out of here!
He's never coming back! Ever!

366
00:57:46,949 --> 00:57:49,486
- Bastard.
- I guess you don't understand English.

367
00:57:49,697 --> 00:57:51,749
She said leave. Here's the door.

368
00:57:51,958 --> 00:57:53,346
Gene!

369
00:57:53,838 --> 00:57:55,190
Get out!

370
00:57:55,891 --> 00:57:57,386
Get out!

371
00:58:01,632 --> 00:58:03,257
Adam Kesher?

372
00:58:25,953 --> 00:58:28,906
- Yeah, what is it, Cookie?
- I'm sorry, Mr. Kesher...

373
00:58:29,118 --> 00:58:32,628
but there seems to be some
problem with your credit cards.

374
00:58:33,535 --> 00:58:35,824
What? I pay you cash, Cookie.

375
00:58:37,885 --> 00:58:41,953
Listen, two guys from
your bank came by.

376
00:58:42,615 --> 00:58:44,419
My bank?

377
00:58:45,365 --> 00:58:48,176
- How'd they know I was here?
- I don't know.

378
00:58:49,645 --> 00:58:51,590
What 'd they say?

379
00:58:51,803 --> 00:58:55,480
They said to tell you that you're
maxed out at your bank...

380
00:58:55,699 --> 00:58:58,960
and that your line of credit
has been canceled.

381
00:59:00,745 --> 00:59:02,761
That 's unbelievable.

382
00:59:04,398 --> 00:59:06,129
Well, look...

383
00:59:08,608 --> 00:59:13,508
I don't know what 's going on.
That is so much baloney.

384
00:59:15,984 --> 00:59:21,784
- I got enough cash for you, Cookie.
- I know, I know. Don't worry.

385
00:59:22,593 --> 00:59:27,600
But I'm sorry, it 's my duty
to inform you...

386
00:59:28,926 --> 00:59:33,648
listen, man,
whoever you're hiding from...

387
00:59:33,867 --> 00:59:36,536
they know where you are.

388
00:59:37,659 --> 00:59:39,462
Right.

389
00:59:40,478 --> 00:59:42,459
I'm sorry.

390
01:00:06,049 --> 01:00:07,080
Hello?

391
01:00:07,441 --> 01:00:11,048
- Someone maybe shut off my money.
- I know. Where are you, Adam?

392
01:00:11,409 --> 01:00:15,750
- Sorry, what do you mean you know?
- Somebody called...

393
01:00:15,966 --> 01:00:20,166
they told me you were as good as
broke. So I made a few calls.

394
01:00:20,768 --> 01:00:22,642
- And?
- You're broke.

395
01:00:22,855 --> 01:00:24,208
I'm not broke!

396
01:00:24,733 --> 01:00:27,021
I know, but you're broke.
Where are you?

397
01:00:28,525 --> 01:00:32,796
- I'm at Cookie's, downtown.
- Do you know somebody called...

398
01:00:33,362 --> 01:00:35,057
"The Cowboy"?

399
01:00:36,075 --> 01:00:38,364
- "The cowboy"?
- Yeah.

400
01:00:38,961 --> 01:00:43,197
"The Cowboy". This guy,
the Cowboy, wants to see you.

401
01:00:43,416 --> 01:00:46,441
Jason said he thought
it would be a good idea.

402
01:00:47,348 --> 01:00:50,540
Jason thought it would be a good
idea for me to go see the Cowboy.

403
01:00:50,759 --> 01:00:54,056
Should I wear my 1O-gallon hat
and my six-shooters?

404
01:00:54,481 --> 01:00:57,707
Something tells me that this guy
is connected to what 's happening.

405
01:00:58,899 --> 01:01:02,303
Adam, I think you should do it, and
you should do it right away.

406
01:01:02,727 --> 01:01:07,625
- What 's going on, Cynthia?
- It's been a very strange day.

407
01:01:09,022 --> 01:01:11,619
And getting stranger.

408
01:01:13,233 --> 01:01:16,637
Where do I meet this Cowboy? Do you
have to ride out to the range?

409
01:01:17,408 --> 01:01:21,856
Sort of, funny boy.
If I tell him the meeting's on...

410
01:01:22,279 --> 01:01:27,630
you'll go to the top of the Beachwood
Canyon, there's a corral up there...

411
01:01:27,846 --> 01:01:31,214
...where he'll be.
- You've gotta be kidding me.

412
01:01:31,603 --> 01:01:33,856
Will you meet with him?

413
01:01:34,073 --> 01:01:35,283
Yeah.

414
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:39,569
Sure. This has been
that kind of a day. When?

415
01:01:39,884 --> 01:01:43,633
I'll call him right away
and then I'll call you back.

416
01:01:44,511 --> 01:01:48,639
You know, you could stay at
my place, if you wanted.

417
01:01:49,069 --> 01:01:54,217
- I don't think that 'd be a good idea.
- I was just offering a place to stay.

418
01:01:54,428 --> 01:01:57,725
Yes, and I appreciate the offer,
Cynthia. I'll find a place.

419
01:01:57,941 --> 01:02:00,931
Just go on and give that cowboy
a yodel and get on back to me.

420
01:02:01,142 --> 01:02:04,687
Okay. But you don't know
what you're missing.

421
01:02:04,899 --> 01:02:07,854
Just get along, little doggie.
And call me back.

422
01:02:19,965 --> 01:02:24,070
It 's right about here. Sierra Bonita.
It 's not too far away.

423
01:02:25,497 --> 01:02:27,714
What 's wrong with that?

424
01:02:28,523 --> 01:02:30,885
I'm not sure about this.

425
01:02:32,283 --> 01:02:35,343
I know you're afraid of something.

426
01:02:35,970 --> 01:02:38,959
We'll be careful. I promise.

427
01:02:39,623 --> 01:02:43,206
Tomorrow. We'll go over there...

428
01:02:43,416 --> 01:02:45,468
and we'll find out.

429
01:02:58,690 --> 01:03:00,907
It'll be okay.

430
01:03:03,176 --> 01:03:05,679
It 's probably Coco.

431
01:03:09,265 --> 01:03:13,678
- Yes, may I help you?
- Someone is in trouble!

432
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:17,783
Who are you?

433
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:21,261
What are you doing
in Ruth's apartment?

434
01:03:21,755 --> 01:03:26,098
She's letting me stay here.
I'm her niece. My name's Betty.

435
01:03:26,314 --> 01:03:30,133
No, it 's not!
That 's not what she said.

436
01:03:30,593 --> 01:03:34,628
Someone is in trouble!
Something bad is happening!

437
01:03:35,605 --> 01:03:38,903
I'm sorry, but I don't know
who you are and...

438
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:42,522
Louise?
What are you doing, Louise?

439
01:03:43,189 --> 01:03:47,814
I've been trying to get hold of you
since 3 o'clock this afternoon.

440
01:03:48,024 --> 01:03:51,251
That one is in my room and
she won't leave!

441
01:03:51,469 --> 01:03:54,529
I want you to get her out.
I want you to get her out now.

442
01:03:55,294 --> 01:03:58,486
This is Louise Bonner.
I'm sure she meant well.

443
01:03:58,705 --> 01:04:01,659
Louise, this is Betty,
this is Ruth's niece.

444
01:04:01,872 --> 01:04:07,115
I was on my way over here to see
Betty. Betty is a young actress.

445
01:04:07,334 --> 01:04:11,366
I was delivering some faxed pages of
a scene for a big audition tomorrow.

446
01:04:11,578 --> 01:04:14,390
- Well, here they are, honey.
- Thank you.

447
01:04:14,606 --> 01:04:17,002
Come along now, Louise.
I'll take you home.

448
01:04:17,215 --> 01:04:19,230
I'm sorry.
It happens sometimes. Come on.

449
01:04:19,441 --> 01:04:22,595
No, she said it was someone
else who was in trouble.

450
01:04:22,814 --> 01:04:26,705
Stop it, Louise!
I'm taking you home. Come on.

451
01:04:27,790 --> 01:04:30,080
- Good night, Betty.
- Good night.

452
01:04:31,131 --> 01:04:32,899
Good night.

453
01:05:11,908 --> 01:05:13,923
Cowboy...

454
01:06:21,214 --> 01:06:24,404
- Howdy.
- Howdy to you.

455
01:06:26,990 --> 01:06:29,279
Beautiful evening.

456
01:06:32,660 --> 01:06:36,302
Thank you for coming all the way
up here to see me from that...

457
01:06:36,523 --> 01:06:38,540
nice hotel downtown.

458
01:06:40,106 --> 01:06:43,202
No problem.
What 's on your mind?

459
01:06:43,412 --> 01:06:47,231
Well, now. Here's a man who
wants to get right down to it.

460
01:06:47,795 --> 01:06:50,572
Kind of anxious
to get to it, are you?

461
01:06:50,789 --> 01:06:52,627
Whatever.

462
01:06:54,095 --> 01:06:56,525
A man's attitude...

463
01:06:56,772 --> 01:07:01,849
a man's attitude goes some ways
the way his life will be.

464
01:07:02,547 --> 01:07:05,086
Is that something
you might agree with?

465
01:07:05,922 --> 01:07:07,618
Sure!

466
01:07:07,836 --> 01:07:11,655
Did you answer because that 's what
you thought I wanted to hear...

467
01:07:11,871 --> 01:07:13,924
or did you think about what I said...

468
01:07:14,133 --> 01:07:18,368
and answered 'cause you
truly believe that to be right?

469
01:07:19,144 --> 01:07:22,858
I agree with what you said. Truly.

470
01:07:24,954 --> 01:07:27,694
What 'd I say?

471
01:07:29,582 --> 01:07:33,509
That a man's attitude determines to
a large extent how his life will be.

472
01:07:35,113 --> 01:07:37,544
So since you agree...

473
01:07:37,757 --> 01:07:42,833
you must be a person who does not
care about the good life.

474
01:07:43,149 --> 01:07:45,059
How's that?

475
01:07:46,594 --> 01:07:48,919
Well, stop for a little second...

476
01:07:49,169 --> 01:07:53,024
and think about it.
Can you do that for me?

477
01:07:55,257 --> 01:07:58,448
Okay. I'm thinking.

478
01:08:01,868 --> 01:08:07,502
No, you're not. You're too busy
being a smart aleck to be thinking.

479
01:08:08,270 --> 01:08:12,541
Now, I want you to think
and stop being a smart aleck.

480
01:08:12,759 --> 01:08:14,977
Can you try that for me?

481
01:08:15,194 --> 01:08:18,870
Look, where's this going?
What do you want me to do?

482
01:08:19,820 --> 01:08:25,063
There's sometimes a buggy.
How many drivers does a buggy have?

483
01:08:25,875 --> 01:08:27,227
One.

484
01:08:27,928 --> 01:08:31,190
So let 's just say
I'm driving this buggy.

485
01:08:31,406 --> 01:08:36,056
And if you fix your attitude,
you can ride along with me.

486
01:08:38,365 --> 01:08:40,797
I want you to go back
to work tomorrow.

487
01:08:41,775 --> 01:08:47,647
You were recasting the lead actress.
Audition many girls for the part.

488
01:08:48,559 --> 01:08:53,600
When you see the girl that was shown
to you earlier today, you will say:

489
01:08:54,022 --> 01:08:56,977
"This is the girl."

490
01:08:57,327 --> 01:09:00,967
The rest of the cast can stay.
That 's up to you.

491
01:09:01,884 --> 01:09:05,183
But that lead girl
is not up to you.

492
01:09:07,139 --> 01:09:11,659
Now, you will see me one more
time if you do good.

493
01:09:12,671 --> 01:09:17,713
You'll see me two more times
if you do bad.

494
01:09:18,344 --> 01:09:19,932
Good night.

495
01:09:45,966 --> 01:09:49,786
- You're still here?
- I thought that 's what you wanted.

496
01:09:50,003 --> 01:09:54,071
- Nobody wants you here!
- Really?

497
01:09:54,281 --> 01:09:57,307
My parents are right upstairs.
They think you've left!

498
01:09:57,518 --> 01:10:01,587
- So? Surprise.
- I can call them. I can call my dad.

499
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:05,790
- But you won't.
- Lf you're trying to blackmail me...

500
01:10:06,495 --> 01:10:09,164
it 's not going to work! You're
playing a dangerous game here.

501
01:10:09,383 --> 01:10:11,744
You know what I want.
It 's not that difficult.

502
01:10:12,028 --> 01:10:15,360
Get out!
Get out before I call my dad!

503
01:10:15,575 --> 01:10:18,599
He trusts you!
You're his best friend.

504
01:10:18,810 --> 01:10:20,958
This will be the
end of everything.

505
01:10:21,177 --> 01:10:24,024
What about you?
What will your dad think about you?

506
01:10:24,238 --> 01:10:28,127
Stop! Just stop it! That 's what
you said from the beginning.

507
01:10:28,969 --> 01:10:32,196
If I tell what happened, they'll
arrest you and put you in jail.
