1
00:04:55,677 --> 00:04:59,681
What are you doing?
We don't stop here!

2
00:05:10,316 --> 00:05:14,071
Get out of the car.

3
00:08:52,998 --> 00:08:54,750
The boys found this...

4
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,418
on the floor in back
of the Caddy.

5
00:08:57,669 --> 00:09:01,548
Yeah, they showed me.

6
00:09:02,132 --> 00:09:04,258
Could be unrelated.

7
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,887
Could be.

8
00:09:07,137 --> 00:09:11,850
Any of those dead kids wearin'
pearl earrings?

9
00:09:13,185 --> 00:09:17,523
No. Could be someone's missin' maybe.

10
00:09:17,773 --> 00:09:21,235
That's what I'm thinkin'.

11
00:09:57,896 --> 00:10:01,567
Just one more bag after that.

12
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:48,924
I just wanted to come here.

13
00:11:49,174 --> 00:11:51,802
To Winkie's?

14
00:11:51,927 --> 00:11:55,097
This Winkie's.

15
00:11:56,347 --> 00:11:59,810
Okay.
Why this Winkie's?

16
00:12:02,187 --> 00:12:05,607
It's kind of embarrassing...

17
00:12:07,025 --> 00:12:10,112
Go ahead.

18
00:12:10,195 --> 00:12:11,947
I had a dream about this place.

19
00:12:12,197 --> 00:12:13,615
Oh boy.

20
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:17,326
You see what I mean?

21
00:12:19,163 --> 00:12:22,583
Okay, so you had a dream
about this place.

22
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:25,794
Tell me.

23
00:12:28,379 --> 00:12:31,340
Well...

24
00:12:31,633 --> 00:12:33,635
it's the second one I've had...

25
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:37,305
but they are both the same...

26
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:39,641
they start out that
I'm in here but...

27
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:43,896
it's not day or night.

28
00:12:44,146 --> 00:12:47,191
It's kinda half night, you know?

29
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,027
But it
looks just like this...

30
00:12:50,276 --> 00:12:53,362
except for the light.

31
00:12:53,614 --> 00:12:57,743
And I'm scared like
I can't tell ya.

32
00:12:58,994 --> 00:13:00,746
Of all people,

33
00:13:00,996 --> 00:13:04,708
you're standing right over there...

34
00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:11,173
by that counter.

35
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:16,637
You're in both dreams
and you're scared.

36
00:13:17,303 --> 00:13:22,226
I get even more frightened when
I see how afraid you are and...

37
00:13:24,686 --> 00:13:28,190
then I realize what it is.

38
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:33,737
There's a man...

39
00:13:33,987 --> 00:13:37,616
in back of this place.

40
00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:41,995
He's the one who's doing it.

41
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:45,289
I can see him through the wall.

42
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:49,002
I can see his face...

43
00:13:53,632 --> 00:13:55,926
I hope that I never
see that face ever...

44
00:13:56,176 --> 00:14:00,222
outside of the dream.

45
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:10,858
That's it.

46
00:14:11,108 --> 00:14:12,651
So...

47
00:14:12,901 --> 00:14:17,321
you came to see if he's out there.

48
00:14:18,782 --> 00:14:22,870
To get rid of this god-awful feeling.

49
00:14:24,872 --> 00:14:28,332
Right then.

50
00:15:13,795 --> 00:15:17,257
It's around here.

51
00:16:25,742 --> 00:16:30,080
Dan? You all right?
Dan? Dan?

52
00:16:56,481 --> 00:16:59,151
Hello?

53
00:16:59,651 --> 00:17:04,656
The girl is still missing.

54
00:17:23,466 --> 00:17:24,718
Talk to me.

55
00:17:24,968 --> 00:17:28,387
The same.

56
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:08,554
Oh...
I can't believe it!

57
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:40,627
It's time to say goodbye, Betty.

58
00:18:40,878 --> 00:18:42,629
It's been so nice
travelling with you.

59
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,175
Thank you, Irene.
I was so excited and nervous.

60
00:18:46,424 --> 00:18:47,843
It was sure great
to have you to talk to.

61
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:50,344
Remember I'll be watching
for you on the big screen.

62
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:54,016
Okay Irene.
Won't that be the day.

63
00:18:54,265 --> 00:18:57,227
Good luck, Betty dear.

64
00:18:57,477 --> 00:19:00,022
Take care of yourself
and be careful.

65
00:19:00,271 --> 00:19:03,859
I will. Thanks again.

66
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:06,904
Betty, it was so nice meeting you.
All the luck in the world.

67
00:19:07,154 --> 00:19:10,448
- Thank you.
- Bye.

68
00:19:18,456 --> 00:19:19,499
My bags!

69
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:22,376
Where to?

70
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:26,089
1612 Havenhurst.

71
00:19:27,423 --> 00:19:30,511
Got it!

72
00:20:46,419 --> 00:20:48,172
Ten bucks says you're Betty.

73
00:20:48,421 --> 00:20:50,924
Yes, I am, Mrs. Lenoix.

74
00:20:51,175 --> 00:20:52,926
It is Mrs. Lenoix isn't it?

75
00:20:53,177 --> 00:20:55,971
Oh, in all my living glory, baby.

76
00:20:56,221 --> 00:20:58,807
- Pleased to meet you.
- Just call me Coco.

77
00:20:59,057 --> 00:21:02,477
Everybody else does.
Wait there, and I'll go get the key.

78
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:05,814
OK, Coco.

79
00:21:08,901 --> 00:21:11,570
Wilkins?!
Wilkins?!?!

80
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:15,574
If that damned dog craps
in the courtyard one more time...

81
00:21:15,824 --> 00:21:19,077
I'm just gonna bake his
little butt for breakfast.

82
00:21:19,327 --> 00:21:21,496
- You don't have pets do you?
- No, I don't.

83
00:21:21,747 --> 00:21:25,000
They're allowed, I just don't like
'em here... for obvious reasons.

84
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,628
You know, there was a man
that lived here once...

85
00:21:27,878 --> 00:21:30,379
that had a prize fighting kangaroo.

86
00:21:30,631 --> 00:21:32,758
Well, you just wouldn't believe...

87
00:21:33,008 --> 00:21:36,803
what that kangaroo
did to this courtyard.

88
00:21:37,054 --> 00:21:39,932
Let's see your Aunt's apartment
...it's a good one.

89
00:21:40,182 --> 00:21:43,644
I can hardly wait!

90
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:51,527
It's unbelievable!

91
00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:54,863
- I told ya.
- Wow!

92
00:21:55,113 --> 00:21:59,076
Well, you and your Aunt probably have
an understanding, so here's the key.

93
00:21:59,325 --> 00:22:01,870
And if you need anything,
just give a holler.

94
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:05,373
Everybody in this building's
pretty much okay with me...

95
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:08,043
or they wouldn't be here.

96
00:22:08,292 --> 00:22:11,462
If you like, later on
I'll introduce you around.

97
00:22:11,713 --> 00:22:15,926
No hard feelings if you don't.

98
00:23:40,384 --> 00:23:43,847
Oh my! I'm sorry. My Aunt Ruth didn't
tell me someone was going to be here.

99
00:23:44,097 --> 00:23:47,267
- I'm so sorry.
- It's OK

100
00:23:47,518 --> 00:23:49,561
I'm Ruth's niece. My name's Betty.

101
00:23:49,812 --> 00:23:53,314
I'm sure she told you I was coming.

102
00:23:53,565 --> 00:23:55,316
There was an accident.

103
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:57,485
I came here.

104
00:23:57,736 --> 00:24:00,155
I understand.
I saw the dress.

105
00:24:00,404 --> 00:24:03,992
Sorry. Are you all right?

106
00:24:04,243 --> 00:24:07,204
What happened?

107
00:24:07,453 --> 00:24:09,873
A car...

108
00:24:10,123 --> 00:24:13,752
a car accident.

109
00:24:14,293 --> 00:24:17,798
Oh... You OK?

110
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,843
I think so.

111
00:24:21,093 --> 00:24:23,386
I was just...

112
00:24:23,637 --> 00:24:25,388
taking a shower.

113
00:24:25,639 --> 00:24:27,390
Oh my god. I'm sorry.

114
00:24:27,641 --> 00:24:32,436
I'll let you get back to that.
I'm going to get unpacked.

115
00:24:35,899 --> 00:24:39,027
What's your name?

116
00:24:41,238 --> 00:24:46,994
I'm sorry. I'll get out of here
and we can talk later.

117
00:25:22,863 --> 00:25:25,741
My name's...
Rita.

118
00:25:25,991 --> 00:25:28,869
Hi...

119
00:25:29,036 --> 00:25:31,454
do you work with my Aunt?

120
00:25:31,705 --> 00:25:34,082
- No... I...
- Sorry...

121
00:25:34,332 --> 00:25:39,462
it's none of my business.

122
00:25:41,673 --> 00:25:43,424
She has pretty red hair...

123
00:25:43,675 --> 00:25:45,761
She's letting me stay here
while she's working on a movie...

124
00:25:46,011 --> 00:25:47,763
that's being made in Canada...

125
00:25:48,013 --> 00:25:51,432
but I guess you already know that.

126
00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:53,936
I couldn't afford a place
like this in a million years.

127
00:25:54,186 --> 00:25:58,023
Unless of course I'm discovered
and become a movie star.

128
00:25:58,272 --> 00:26:01,317
Of course, I'd rather be known as
a great actress than a movie star,

129
00:26:01,568 --> 00:26:03,737
but sometimes people
end up being both...

130
00:26:03,987 --> 00:26:09,993
so that is, I guess you'd say,
sort of why I came here.

131
00:26:12,204 --> 00:26:15,666
I'm sorry,
I'm just so excited to be here...

132
00:26:15,916 --> 00:26:18,252
I mean I just came here
from Deep River, Ontario...

133
00:26:18,502 --> 00:26:21,088
now I'm in this...

134
00:26:21,337 --> 00:26:23,048
dream place.

135
00:26:23,297 --> 00:26:27,052
You can imagine how I feel.

136
00:26:32,099 --> 00:26:36,603
Oh... What? Sit down...

137
00:26:39,606 --> 00:26:43,068
Where were you hurt?

138
00:26:44,111 --> 00:26:45,988
- We should call a doctor.
- No.

139
00:26:46,238 --> 00:26:48,782
- But, this could be serious.
- No, I...

140
00:26:49,032 --> 00:26:50,617
I need to sleep.

141
00:26:50,868 --> 00:26:52,911
If you have a concussion
you shouldn't sleep.

142
00:26:53,162 --> 00:26:55,706
It will feel okay if I sleep.

143
00:26:55,956 --> 00:27:00,878
I just need to
lie down here and sleep.

144
00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:00,604
You see Adam...
there are some suggestions

145
00:28:00,854 --> 00:28:02,815
that are to be brought forward...

146
00:28:03,065 --> 00:28:05,984
and I know you said you
would entertain suggestions

147
00:28:06,235 --> 00:28:10,279
and that's all anybody here
is asking you to do.

148
00:28:10,531 --> 00:28:12,490
What are you talking about?

149
00:28:12,741 --> 00:28:15,118
An open mind...

150
00:28:15,368 --> 00:28:18,412
You're in the process of
re-casting your lead actress and

151
00:28:18,664 --> 00:28:20,414
I'm...

152
00:28:20,666 --> 00:28:26,337
We're asking you to
keep an open mind.

153
00:28:35,471 --> 00:28:38,892
What was it last time?

154
00:28:40,769 --> 00:28:42,646
OK. Let's try the next one.

155
00:28:42,896 --> 00:28:45,190
He's not gonna like it.

156
00:28:45,439 --> 00:28:48,527
We'll see.

157
00:28:54,199 --> 00:28:56,076
Ah... Castigliane brothers.

158
00:28:56,325 --> 00:28:59,746
Let me introduce you around...

159
00:28:59,781 --> 00:29:02,958
please... take a seat.

160
00:29:03,208 --> 00:29:05,252
This is Mr. Darby,
whom you know...

161
00:29:05,502 --> 00:29:08,922
and this is the
director Adam Kesher...

162
00:29:09,173 --> 00:29:13,927
and his manager Robert Smith.

163
00:29:45,167 --> 00:29:47,293
Oh,

164
00:29:47,544 --> 00:29:50,964
She's very pretty.

165
00:29:51,048 --> 00:29:56,011
May I offer you, gentlemen...
anything?

166
00:29:56,678 --> 00:29:59,181
- Espresso.
- Nothing.

167
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:04,393
- What's the photo for?
- An espresso.

168
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,605
No, that's it.

169
00:30:06,855 --> 00:30:08,899
I think you're gonna enjoy
your espresso this time.

170
00:30:09,149 --> 00:30:12,653
I've done quite a bit of a research
knowing how hard you are to please.

171
00:30:12,903 --> 00:30:15,321
This one comes highly recommended.

172
00:30:15,572 --> 00:30:18,449
What's the photo for?

173
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,702
It's a recommendation...

174
00:30:20,953 --> 00:30:24,873
a recommendation to you, Adam,

175
00:30:25,123 --> 00:30:28,877
- It's not a recommendation.
- This is the girl.

176
00:30:29,127 --> 00:30:32,756
What girl? For what?
What is this, Ray?

177
00:30:33,006 --> 00:30:37,261
We'd be happy to put her
on the list for consideration.

178
00:30:37,511 --> 00:30:42,724
You'd be pleased to know there's
quite a bit of interest in this role.

179
00:30:42,975 --> 00:30:45,269
Interest? No.

180
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:48,063
There's six of the top
actresses that want this thing.

181
00:30:48,312 --> 00:30:49,731
This is the girl.

182
00:30:49,982 --> 00:30:52,901
- Ray, take care of this.
- Hold on, Adam.

183
00:30:53,152 --> 00:30:54,903
Hold on?

184
00:30:55,154 --> 00:30:59,074
There's no way.
There's no way!

185
00:31:12,838 --> 00:31:15,423
Napkin.

186
00:31:15,674 --> 00:31:18,886
- Pardon?
- Napkin.

187
00:31:19,136 --> 00:31:21,597
Of course.

188
00:31:21,847 --> 00:31:25,267
Excuse me.

189
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:43,911
Is that all sir?

190
00:32:39,423 --> 00:32:40,383
Shit.

191
00:32:40,634 --> 00:32:43,053
Sorry!
That was a highly recommended...

192
00:32:43,302 --> 00:32:45,556
That's considered one of the finest
espressos in the world, Sir.

193
00:32:45,806 --> 00:32:49,308
What's going on here? There's no
way that girl is in my movie.

194
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:52,813
HELP ME!

195
00:32:53,063 --> 00:32:54,523
This is the girl.

196
00:32:54,773 --> 00:32:59,736
Hey!
That girl is not in my film!

197
00:33:01,071 --> 00:33:04,992
It's no longer your film.

198
00:33:08,494 --> 00:33:11,957
This is the girl.

199
00:33:49,452 --> 00:33:52,873
Did the Castigliane brothers
get out of that limo?

200
00:33:52,998 --> 00:33:55,125
- The two guys in dark suits?
- Yeah.

201
00:33:55,374 --> 00:33:59,505
- Yes.
- Keep that door open.

202
00:34:08,429 --> 00:34:10,098
Castigliane brothers?

203
00:34:10,348 --> 00:34:13,769
Beat it, pal.

204
00:34:56,728 --> 00:35:00,190
Good afternoon, Mr. Roque.

205
00:35:00,941 --> 00:35:04,987
Her name's Camilla Rhodes.

206
00:35:05,237 --> 00:35:09,783
The director doesn't want her.

207
00:35:11,201 --> 00:35:15,664
Do you want him replaced?

208
00:35:16,582 --> 00:35:20,043
I know they said...

209
00:35:20,586 --> 00:35:22,921
Then?

210
00:35:23,172 --> 00:35:25,339
Then...

211
00:35:25,591 --> 00:35:29,011
that means we should...

212
00:35:31,138 --> 00:35:34,141
Yes?

213
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:36,143
Shut everything down...

214
00:35:36,392 --> 00:35:39,730
Is that something that...

215
00:35:40,438 --> 00:35:42,232
do you want us...

216
00:35:42,482 --> 00:35:45,944
to shut everything down?

217
00:35:49,698 --> 00:35:54,161
Then we'll shut everything down.

218
00:36:22,022 --> 00:36:25,441
Oh man, that's unheard of...

219
00:36:25,692 --> 00:36:30,321
an accident like that...
who could have foreseen that?

220
00:36:31,156 --> 00:36:32,991
That's unreal, right?

221
00:36:33,242 --> 00:36:35,744
Hell, yeah.

222
00:36:35,994 --> 00:36:39,623
Unbelievable.

223
00:36:44,628 --> 00:36:46,964
So, bro... God you look good!

224
00:36:47,214 --> 00:36:48,966
What have you been doin'?

225
00:36:49,216 --> 00:36:52,426
Just doin' some stuff
for this guy.

226
00:36:52,678 --> 00:36:55,556
Yeah? Making ends meet, huh?

227
00:36:55,806 --> 00:36:59,357
Hardly.

228
00:36:59,392 --> 00:37:00,936
I know, man.

229
00:37:01,186 --> 00:37:04,064
Look at my digs.

230
00:37:04,313 --> 00:37:07,400
Times are tough, bro.

231
00:37:07,693 --> 00:37:11,780
Hey, man, it's not that bad.

232
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:13,782
I hope you're not goin'
to get in any trouble.

233
00:37:14,032 --> 00:37:15,826
It was just a thing.

234
00:37:16,076 --> 00:37:17,828
The story made you laugh.

235
00:37:18,078 --> 00:37:23,041
- It was a funny story.
- Fucking car accident.

236
00:37:25,043 --> 00:37:28,130
Hey, so that's it?

237
00:37:28,379 --> 00:37:32,217
It's the famous black book.

238
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:39,183
The history of the world
in phone numbers.

239
00:38:08,294 --> 00:38:11,757
Oh, man!

240
00:38:22,684 --> 00:38:26,354
Something bit me BAD!

241
00:39:00,304 --> 00:39:03,267
God!

242
00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:16,572
Hey man!

243
00:39:16,822 --> 00:39:21,284
She's hurt bad! Could you come here and
call on the phone. Please I need you!

244
00:39:21,535 --> 00:39:26,081
She's hurt bad!
You gotta call the hospital.

245
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:28,083
Come on man!
I'm serious about this!

246
00:39:28,332 --> 00:39:32,420
I can't do everything by myself!

247
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:54,568
Hey man!

248
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:38,111
OH!

249
00:40:52,375 --> 00:40:55,170
...okay Aunt Ruth... I'll try.

250
00:40:55,419 --> 00:41:00,424
I'm gonna study those lines
until I know them inside out.

251
00:41:00,676 --> 00:41:03,637
Yep, either here on this
fabulous leather couch...

252
00:41:03,887 --> 00:41:05,639
or I'll take them with
a coffee in the courtyard...

253
00:41:05,889 --> 00:41:08,517
like a regular movie star.

254
00:41:08,767 --> 00:41:11,061
Oh! I got a real shock to
find your friend Rita here.

255
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:14,598
She was in the shower and
I opened the door...

256
00:41:14,814 --> 00:41:17,000
Rita.

257
00:41:17,192 --> 00:41:19,736
What do you mean?

258
00:41:19,987 --> 00:41:23,031
Well, she was in an accident.

259
00:41:23,282 --> 00:41:27,451
Rita... your friend.

260
00:41:27,619 --> 00:41:31,455
No, Coco unlocked the door.

261
00:41:31,497 --> 00:41:34,458
No, she didn't see her.

262
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:37,588
She's sleeping.

263
00:41:37,838 --> 00:41:39,548
I'm sure there's some explanation
for this Aunt Ruth,

264
00:41:39,798 --> 00:41:43,552
I don't think we have to do that.

265
00:41:44,511 --> 00:41:49,850
Please don't worry...
we don't need the police.

266
00:42:02,154 --> 00:42:04,781
You're awake...

267
00:42:07,826 --> 00:42:09,578
I think I misunderstood.

268
00:42:09,828 --> 00:42:13,248
I thought you knew my Aunt and
that's why you were here.

269
00:42:13,498 --> 00:42:18,629
I just talked to my Aunt on the phone
and she wants me to call the police.

270
00:42:28,847 --> 00:42:31,141
I'm... sorry. I...

271
00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:34,853
What is it Rita?

272
00:42:37,105 --> 00:42:39,440
I thought when I woke up...

273
00:42:39,691 --> 00:42:42,277
I thought sleep would do it...

274
00:42:42,528 --> 00:42:45,404
What's wrong?

275
00:42:46,698 --> 00:42:48,909
I don't know who I am.

276
00:42:49,159 --> 00:42:51,119
What do you mean?
You're Rita.

277
00:42:51,369 --> 00:42:55,456
I'm not.
I don't know what my name is.

278
00:42:55,707 --> 00:43:00,128
I don't know who I am!

279
00:43:09,054 --> 00:43:14,350
This is your purse.
Your name must be in your purse.

280
00:43:14,601 --> 00:43:17,938
You want to know, don't you?

281
00:43:18,188 --> 00:43:21,900
- I... yes, but... I...
- Open it!

282
00:44:55,493 --> 00:44:59,122
- You sure you don't want anything?
- Not here... no thanks.

283
00:44:59,372 --> 00:45:02,000
Not a coke or something?

284
00:45:02,251 --> 00:45:03,752
No... thanks though...

285
00:45:04,002 --> 00:45:08,215
I'll take a
cigarette if you have one.

286
00:45:09,591 --> 00:45:13,720
Sure, reach inside my shirt pocket there.

287
00:45:17,182 --> 00:45:20,853
Any new girls on the street lately?

288
00:45:23,856 --> 00:45:27,276
No. I haven't seen any.

289
00:45:27,441 --> 00:45:29,278
A brunette?

290
00:45:29,528 --> 00:45:32,948
Maybe a little beat up?

291
00:45:38,036 --> 00:45:40,413
You'll keep your eyes open
for me won't you baby?

292
00:45:40,664 --> 00:45:45,418
- Sure.
- You bet you will.

293
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:50,381
That money.

294
00:45:51,175 --> 00:45:56,013
You don't know where it came from?

295
00:45:56,555 --> 00:46:02,393
When you think of them...
the money... the key...

296
00:46:02,853 --> 00:46:07,274
does it make you remember anything?

297
00:46:07,691 --> 00:46:11,702
Something...

298
00:46:11,737 --> 00:46:15,949
...something there.

299
00:46:26,752 --> 00:46:28,336
What did you say?

300
00:46:28,587 --> 00:46:30,506
They fired everyone.

301
00:46:30,756 --> 00:46:32,800
Who fired everyone?

302
00:46:33,050 --> 00:46:37,179
Ray did!
Please I'm talking on the phone,

303
00:46:37,428 --> 00:46:40,348
and then they closed the set...
everybody's gone.

304
00:46:40,599 --> 00:46:44,019
You'd better get down here Adam!

305
00:46:45,353 --> 00:46:47,940
You've got to talk to Ray
you've got to fix this.

306
00:46:48,190 --> 00:46:49,650
I'm going home.

307
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:51,193
Home?!

308
00:46:51,442 --> 00:46:53,195
Meet me at the office.
We've got to do something.

309
00:46:53,444 --> 00:46:55,197
You've got to do something Adam!

310
00:46:55,446 --> 00:46:57,365
I'm going home, Cynthia.

311
00:46:57,616 --> 00:46:59,450
Adam, this isn't like you.

312
00:46:59,701 --> 00:47:01,119
Please come to the office.

313
00:47:01,369 --> 00:47:05,498
- There must be something we can do.
- I'm going home.

314
00:47:15,092 --> 00:47:18,887
I wonder where you were going.

315
00:47:22,266 --> 00:47:25,936
Mulholland Drive.

316
00:47:29,648 --> 00:47:32,818
Mulholland Drive?

317
00:47:33,569 --> 00:47:35,571
That's where I was going...

318
00:47:35,821 --> 00:47:39,825
Mulholland Drive.

319
00:47:40,075 --> 00:47:43,745
Maybe that's where the accident was.

320
00:47:43,996 --> 00:47:47,498
There must be a police report.
We could call...

321
00:47:47,749 --> 00:47:49,501
We could call anonymously
from a pay phone...

322
00:47:49,751 --> 00:47:52,671
just to see if there was an accident.

323
00:47:52,921 --> 00:47:55,339
Come on. It'll be just
like in the movies.

324
00:47:55,591 --> 00:47:59,553
We'll pretend to be someone else.

325
00:47:59,803 --> 00:48:01,638
I want to walk around anyway.

326
00:48:01,889 --> 00:48:05,100
I'm in Hollywood and I haven't
even seen any of it.

327
00:48:05,349 --> 00:48:09,813
Come on Rita.
Do you feel up to it?

328
00:48:17,696 --> 00:48:21,365
Okay... but just...

329
00:48:21,867 --> 00:48:24,161
just to see.

330
00:48:24,410 --> 00:48:28,414
Just to see
if there was an accident...

331
00:48:28,665 --> 00:48:32,628
on Mulholland Drive.

332
00:49:13,752 --> 00:49:16,505
Lorraine?

333
00:49:16,755 --> 00:49:20,217
Lorraine... you home?

334
00:49:20,592 --> 00:49:22,970
Lorraine...

335
00:49:44,074 --> 00:49:47,493
Now, you've done it!

336
00:49:48,245 --> 00:49:53,125
Just forget you ever saw.
It's better that way.

337
00:49:54,333 --> 00:49:58,922
What the hell are you
even doing here?

338
00:50:09,266 --> 00:50:13,436
What are you doing?

339
00:50:14,855 --> 00:50:17,816
THAT'S MY JEWELRY!

340
00:50:33,665 --> 00:50:36,877
That bastard.
You bastard!

341
00:50:37,127 --> 00:50:40,798
He's probably upset Lorraine.

342
00:50:45,761 --> 00:50:49,305
WHAT... ARE... YOU... DOING!?

343
00:50:49,347 --> 00:50:52,433
STOP IT!
STOP IT!

344
00:50:52,684 --> 00:50:54,728
Adam, STOP IT!

345
00:50:54,978 --> 00:50:58,106
STOP IT!
STOP IT!

346
00:50:58,356 --> 00:51:02,778
Adam, STOP IT!

347
00:51:02,861 --> 00:51:08,617
What're you doin'
You're hurting me!

348
00:51:11,703 --> 00:51:15,958
That's not a way to treat your wife,
buddy. I don't care what she's done.

349
00:51:16,208 --> 00:51:19,127
Throw him out!

350
00:51:21,295 --> 00:51:26,467
Throw him out!

351
00:51:31,682 --> 00:51:35,269
Get out!

352
00:52:13,098 --> 00:52:16,560
Let's hide it.

353
00:53:00,311 --> 00:53:03,774
There's one.

354
00:53:17,830 --> 00:53:19,873
Hollywood Police Department

355
00:53:20,123 --> 00:53:23,627
I'm inquiring about an accident that
happened last night on Mulholland Drive.

356
00:53:23,877 --> 00:53:27,756
Hold please.
I'll connect you to traffic.

357
00:53:28,339 --> 00:53:33,262
- Sergeant Baxter,
- Hi. I'm inquiring...

358
00:53:33,469 --> 00:53:36,974
well, I heard a sound last night that
sounded sort of like a car-crash and...

359
00:53:37,224 --> 00:53:41,103
I want to know if there was an
accident on Mulholland Drive.

360
00:53:41,352 --> 00:53:43,105
Yes, there was.

361
00:53:43,354 --> 00:53:46,233
- Can you tell me what happened?
- No. I can't.

362
00:53:46,482 --> 00:53:50,779
- Was anyone hurt?
- May I have your name please?

363
00:53:56,201 --> 00:53:58,287
There was an accident.

364
00:53:58,537 --> 00:54:00,329
He wouldn't tell me anything else,
but that was your accident Rita.

365
00:54:00,581 --> 00:54:04,007
I just know it was.

366
00:54:04,042 --> 00:54:06,461
Maybe there's something
about it in the papers.

367
00:54:06,712 --> 00:54:10,465
Come on we'll buy a cup of coffee
and we can see.

368
00:54:13,177 --> 00:54:16,638
Maybe it happened so late it's
not going to be in today's paper.

369
00:54:16,889 --> 00:54:20,349
There's nothing?

370
00:54:20,433 --> 00:54:23,979
Not that I can see.

371
00:54:24,229 --> 00:54:27,315
That's Ok.

372
00:54:30,527 --> 00:54:31,195
Thanks...

373
00:54:31,444 --> 00:54:36,200
...Diane.

374
00:54:40,453 --> 00:54:42,831
That'd be all?
You want your check?

375
00:54:43,081 --> 00:54:46,417
Rita, you want something?

376
00:54:47,836 --> 00:54:53,675
- No. Just the coffee.
- I'll take our check.

377
00:54:59,556 --> 00:55:02,976
- What is it Rita?
- Shhhh.

378
00:55:09,525 --> 00:55:12,986
I remember something...

379
00:55:17,241 --> 00:55:20,536
- What is it?
- Diane Selwyn.

380
00:55:20,786 --> 00:55:24,748
Maybe that's my name.

381
00:55:28,585 --> 00:55:32,463
D. Selwyn... it's the only one.

382
00:55:32,714 --> 00:55:36,176
I'm gonna call.

383
00:55:41,974 --> 00:55:44,059
It's strange to be calling yourself.

384
00:55:44,308 --> 00:55:47,771
Maybe it's not me.

385
00:55:55,070 --> 00:55:56,822
Hello... this is me.

386
00:55:57,072 --> 00:56:00,449
Leave me a message.

387
00:56:01,243 --> 00:56:04,495
It's not my voice...

388
00:56:04,746 --> 00:56:08,208
but I know her.

389
00:56:08,625 --> 00:56:11,962
Maybe that isn't
Diane Selwyn's voice.

390
00:56:12,212 --> 00:56:14,256
Maybe that's your roommate...

391
00:56:14,506 --> 00:56:16,717
or if it is Diane Selwyn...

392
00:56:16,967 --> 00:56:20,012
she can tell you who you are.

393
00:56:20,262 --> 00:56:25,934
Maybe. Maybe. Maybe.

394
00:57:05,224 --> 00:57:07,810
- Yeah, right... get lost!
- Is this Adam Kesher's house?

395
00:57:08,060 --> 00:57:09,603
Like hell it is! Get out... NOW!

396
00:57:09,853 --> 00:57:12,940
Get out!

397
00:57:20,072 --> 00:57:25,285
Get out of here!
He's never coming back! Ever!

398
00:57:26,662 --> 00:57:28,789
I guess you don't understand English.
She said to leave.

399
00:57:29,039 --> 00:57:31,792
Here's the door.

400
00:57:32,042 --> 00:57:36,171
OUT!

401
00:58:04,658 --> 00:58:07,286
- Yeah... what is it, Cookie?
- I'm sorry Mr. Kesher...

402
00:58:07,536 --> 00:58:11,372
but there seems to be some problem
with your credit cards.

403
00:58:11,623 --> 00:58:15,878
What? I pay you cash, Cookie.

404
00:58:17,921 --> 00:58:21,008
Fact is two guys
from your bank came by.

405
00:58:21,258 --> 00:58:23,677
My bank?

406
00:58:23,927 --> 00:58:28,140
- How'd they know I was here?
- I don't know.

407
00:58:28,265 --> 00:58:29,432
What did they say?

408
00:58:29,683 --> 00:58:33,979
I'm afraid they said
you're maxed out at your bank...

409
00:58:34,229 --> 00:58:39,026
and your line of credit
has been cancelled.

410
00:58:39,234 --> 00:58:42,613
It's unbelievable.

411
00:58:42,905 --> 00:58:45,991
Look...

412
00:58:47,075 --> 00:58:49,912
I don't know what's going on.

413
00:58:50,162 --> 00:58:53,624
That's so much baloney.

414
00:58:54,625 --> 00:58:56,668
I've got enough cash for you Cookie.

415
00:58:56,919 --> 00:58:59,004
I know... I know...

416
00:58:59,254 --> 00:59:01,048
Don't worry...

417
00:59:01,297 --> 00:59:03,926
I'm sorry.

418
00:59:04,176 --> 00:59:07,596
It was my duty to inform you.

419
00:59:10,057 --> 00:59:15,771
People you're hiding from,
they know where you are.

420
00:59:16,063 --> 00:59:19,024
Right.

421
00:59:19,066 --> 00:59:22,194
I'm sorry.

422
00:59:44,382 --> 00:59:45,509
Hello?

423
00:59:45,759 --> 00:59:47,553
Someone's maybe shut off my money!

424
00:59:47,803 --> 00:59:49,555
I know. Where are you Adam?

425
00:59:49,805 --> 00:59:51,849
What do you mean you know?

426
00:59:52,099 --> 00:59:53,851
Somebody called.
When they couldn't get you...

427
00:59:54,101 --> 00:59:56,270
they told me you
were as good as broke.

428
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:58,564
I didn't believe them,
so I made a few calls.

429
00:59:58,814 --> 01:00:00,983
- And?
- You're broke!

430
01:00:01,233 --> 01:00:02,609
But I'm not broke!

431
01:00:02,860 --> 01:00:07,114
I know, but you're broke.
Where are you?

432
01:00:07,239 --> 01:00:09,658
I'm at Cookie's Downtown.

433
01:00:09,908 --> 01:00:14,328
Do you know somebody
called the "The Cowboy"?

434
01:00:14,580 --> 01:00:16,707
- "The Cowboy"?
- Yes.

435
01:00:16,957 --> 01:00:18,416
Yeah, the Cowboy.

436
01:00:18,667 --> 01:00:21,545
This guy, the Cowboy,
wants to see you.

437
01:00:21,795 --> 01:00:25,674
Jason said he thought
it would be a good idea.

438
01:00:25,966 --> 01:00:29,011
Oh, Jason thought it would be a good
idea for me to go to see the Cowboy.

439
01:00:29,261 --> 01:00:32,388
Should I wear my ten gallon
hat and my six shooters?

440
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:37,144
Listen. Something tells me this guy
is connected to what's happening,

441
01:00:37,393 --> 01:00:41,064
and I think you should do it and
I think you should do it right away.

442
01:00:41,314 --> 01:00:43,066
What's going on, Cynthia?

443
01:00:43,316 --> 01:00:47,237
It's been a very strange day...

444
01:00:47,613 --> 01:00:51,033
and getting stranger.

445
01:00:51,909 --> 01:00:55,829
Where do I meet this Cowboy? I mean...
do I have to ride out to the range?

446
01:00:56,079 --> 01:00:58,123
Sort of, funny boy.

447
01:00:58,372 --> 01:01:00,209
If I tell him the
meeting's on...

448
01:01:00,458 --> 01:01:03,086
you have to go to the top of
Beachwood Canyon.

449
01:01:03,336 --> 01:01:07,174
There's a corral up
there where he'll be.

450
01:01:07,423 --> 01:01:09,885
You've got to be kidding me!

451
01:01:10,135 --> 01:01:12,303
Will you meet with him?

452
01:01:12,554 --> 01:01:14,598
Yeah, sure.

453
01:01:14,848 --> 01:01:17,976
It's been that kind of a day.
When?

454
01:01:18,227 --> 01:01:20,145
I'll call him, right away...

455
01:01:20,394 --> 01:01:22,898
then I'll call you back.

456
01:01:23,148 --> 01:01:28,070
You could stay at my place,
if you want it.

457
01:01:28,319 --> 01:01:30,280
Cynthia... I don't think
it'll be a good idea.

458
01:01:30,531 --> 01:01:32,616
I'm just offering a place to stay.

459
01:01:32,866 --> 01:01:35,911
And I appreciate the offer,
Cynthia. I'll find a place.

460
01:01:36,161 --> 01:01:39,372
Now go on and give the Cowboy
a yodel and get back to me.

461
01:01:39,623 --> 01:01:43,127
Okay, but you don't know
what you're missing.

462
01:01:43,376 --> 01:01:48,173
Just get along little dowgie
and call me back.

463
01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:00,811
It's right about
here on Sierra Bonita.

464
01:02:01,061 --> 01:02:03,897
That's not too far away.

465
01:02:04,148 --> 01:02:06,942
What's wrong with that?

466
01:02:07,192 --> 01:02:10,654
I'm not sure about this.

467
01:02:11,029 --> 01:02:14,323
I know you're afraid of something.

468
01:02:14,575 --> 01:02:18,245
We'll be careful. Promise.

469
01:02:18,287 --> 01:02:21,748
Tomorrow we'll go over there...

470
01:02:21,999 --> 01:02:25,544
and we'll find out.

471
01:02:37,305 --> 01:02:40,391
It'll be okay.

472
01:02:41,768 --> 01:02:45,230
It's probably Coco.

473
01:02:47,191 --> 01:02:48,441
Yes?

474
01:02:48,692 --> 01:02:49,860
May I help you?

475
01:02:50,110 --> 01:02:53,739
Someone is in trouble.

476
01:02:54,072 --> 01:02:56,742
Who are you?

477
01:02:56,992 --> 01:02:59,661
What are you doing
in Ruth's apartment?

478
01:02:59,912 --> 01:03:01,830
She's letting me stay here.

479
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:04,499
I'm her niece. My name's Betty.

480
01:03:04,750 --> 01:03:06,293
No it's not.

481
01:03:06,543 --> 01:03:08,962
That's not what she said.

482
01:03:09,213 --> 01:03:13,717
Someone is in trouble.
Something bad is happening!

483
01:03:13,967 --> 01:03:17,303
I'm sorry, but I don't know
who you are and...

484
01:03:17,554 --> 01:03:22,017
Louise...
What are you doing Louise?

485
01:03:22,810 --> 01:03:26,188
Oh, Coco! I've been trying to find
you all afternoon since 3:00 o'clock.

486
01:03:26,437 --> 01:03:29,608
That one is in my room
and she won't leave.

487
01:03:29,858 --> 01:03:33,529
I want you to get her out.
I want you to get her out now.

488
01:03:33,779 --> 01:03:36,364
This is Louise Bonner.
I'm sure she meant well.

489
01:03:36,615 --> 01:03:40,536
Louise, this is Betty,
this is Ruth's niece.

490
01:03:40,786 --> 01:03:43,664
In fact and fortunately I was
just on my way here to see Betty.

491
01:03:43,914 --> 01:03:46,457
Betty's a young actress
and I was just delivering...

492
01:03:46,708 --> 01:03:49,878
some faxed pages of a scene
for a big audition tomorrow.

493
01:03:50,129 --> 01:03:52,714
- Well, here they are honey.
- Oh, thank you.

494
01:03:52,965 --> 01:03:55,383
Now come along Louise
and I'll take you home.

495
01:03:55,634 --> 01:03:58,344
I'm sorry. It happens sometimes.
Come on.

496
01:03:58,595 --> 01:04:00,931
No, she said it was someone else
who was in trouble.

497
01:04:01,181 --> 01:04:04,101
Stop it, Louise.
I'm taking you home...

498
01:04:04,350 --> 01:04:06,186
Come on.

499
01:04:06,435 --> 01:04:09,022
- Goodnight Betty.
- Goodnight.

500
01:04:09,273 --> 01:04:12,358
Goodnight.

501
01:04:50,354 --> 01:04:53,316
Cowboy!

502
01:06:00,300 --> 01:06:04,470
- Howdy!
- Howdy to you.

503
01:06:05,222 --> 01:06:08,349
Beautiful evening.

504
01:06:11,352 --> 01:06:13,689
Sure want to thank ya for coming
all the way up to see me...

505
01:06:13,939 --> 01:06:17,755
from that nice hotel Downtown.

506
01:06:17,790 --> 01:06:21,572
No problem.
What's on your mind?

507
01:06:21,822 --> 01:06:26,160
Well now, here's a man who
wants to get right down to it.

508
01:06:26,409 --> 01:06:29,037
Kinda anxious to get to it are ya?

509
01:06:29,288 --> 01:06:32,207
Whatever.

510
01:06:32,666 --> 01:06:35,127
A man's attitude...

511
01:06:35,376 --> 01:06:38,005
a man's attitude goes some ways...

512
01:06:38,255 --> 01:06:40,883
the way his life will be.

513
01:06:41,133 --> 01:06:44,219
Is that somethin'
you might agree with?

514
01:06:44,469 --> 01:06:46,096
Sure.

515
01:06:46,345 --> 01:06:50,017
Now... did you answer because you thought
that's what I wanted to hear...

516
01:06:50,267 --> 01:06:52,310
or did you think about what I said...

517
01:06:52,561 --> 01:06:57,524
and answer cause you
truly believe that to be right?

518
01:06:57,774 --> 01:07:03,321
I agree with what you said... truly.

519
01:07:03,572 --> 01:07:07,034
What did I say?

520
01:07:08,326 --> 01:07:13,582
That a man's attitude determines to a
large extent how his life will be.

521
01:07:13,707 --> 01:07:16,126
So since you agree...

522
01:07:16,375 --> 01:07:21,215
you must be a person who does
not care about the good life.

523
01:07:21,464 --> 01:07:25,177
How's that?

524
01:07:25,260 --> 01:07:29,097
Well, stop for a little second
and think about it.

525
01:07:29,347 --> 01:07:33,101
Can you do that for me?

526
01:07:33,977 --> 01:07:38,524
Okay, I'm thinking.

527
01:07:40,483 --> 01:07:42,318
No. You're not thinkin'

528
01:07:42,569 --> 01:07:46,698
You're too busy being
a smart aleck to be thinkin'.

529
01:07:46,949 --> 01:07:51,078
Now I want ya to think
and stop bein' a smart aleck.

530
01:07:51,327 --> 01:07:53,496
Can you try that for me?

531
01:07:53,747 --> 01:07:58,293
Look... where's this going?
What do you want me to do?

532
01:07:58,544 --> 01:08:00,963
There's sometimes a buggy.

533
01:08:01,213 --> 01:08:04,340
How many drivers does a buggy have?

534
01:08:04,591 --> 01:08:06,342
One.

535
01:08:06,593 --> 01:08:09,638
So let's just say
I'm drivin' this buggy...

536
01:08:09,888 --> 01:08:14,643
and you if fix your attitude
you can ride along with me.

537
01:08:15,060 --> 01:08:16,186
Okay.

538
01:08:16,435 --> 01:08:20,232
I want you to go back
to work tomorrow.

539
01:08:20,481 --> 01:08:22,776
You were re-casting the lead
actress anyway...

540
01:08:23,026 --> 01:08:26,947
audition many girls for the part.

541
01:08:27,197 --> 01:08:31,994
When you see the girl that was shown
to you earlier today, you will say:

542
01:08:32,244 --> 01:08:35,371
"This is the girl".

543
01:08:35,622 --> 01:08:37,958
The rest of the cast can stay.

544
01:08:38,208 --> 01:08:40,669
That is up to you.

545
01:08:40,919 --> 01:08:45,299
But that lead girl
is not up to you.

546
01:08:45,841 --> 01:08:48,510
Now, you will see me
one more time...

547
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:51,180
if you do good.

548
01:08:51,429 --> 01:08:54,307
You will see me two more times...

549
01:08:54,558 --> 01:08:56,727
if you do bad.

550
01:08:56,977 --> 01:09:00,105
Good night.

551
01:09:23,629 --> 01:09:25,379
You're still here?

552
01:09:25,631 --> 01:09:28,258
I came back.
I thought that's what you wanted.

553
01:09:28,509 --> 01:09:31,094
Nobody wants you here!

554
01:09:31,344 --> 01:09:33,013
Really?

555
01:09:33,263 --> 01:09:35,724
My parents are right upstairs!
They think you've left.

556
01:09:35,974 --> 01:09:39,978
- So... surprise...
- I can call them... I can call my dad...

557
01:09:40,229 --> 01:09:42,231
But you won't...

558
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:45,609
If you're trying to blackmail me...
it's not going to work.

559
01:09:45,859 --> 01:09:47,694
You're playing a dangerous game here.

560
01:09:47,945 --> 01:09:50,113
You know what I want...
it's not that difficult.

561
01:09:50,363 --> 01:09:53,742
Get out!
Get out before I call my dad...

562
01:09:53,992 --> 01:09:56,954
he trusts you...
you're his best friend.

563
01:09:57,204 --> 01:09:59,497
This will be the end of everything.

564
01:09:59,748 --> 01:10:02,793
What about you?
What will your dad think about you?

565
01:10:03,043 --> 01:10:07,380
Stop! Just stop! That's what
you said from the beginning.

566
01:10:07,506 --> 01:10:10,551
If I tell what happened...
they'll arrest you and put you in jail.

567
01:10:10,801 --> 01:10:12,636
So get out of here before...

568
01:10:12,886 --> 01:10:16,223
Before what?

569
01:10:16,472 --> 01:10:19,518
Before I kill you.

570
01:10:19,768 --> 01:10:23,605
Then they'd put you in jail.

571
01:10:25,274 --> 01:10:29,069
Then I cry, cry, cry, and then
I say with big emotion:

572
01:10:29,318 --> 01:10:33,574
"I hate you... I hate us both!"

573
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:36,743
Such a lame scene.

574
01:10:36,994 --> 01:10:40,080
But you are really good.

575
01:10:40,329 --> 01:10:43,416
Thank you dahling!

576
01:10:57,430 --> 01:10:58,306
Hi there!

577
01:10:58,557 --> 01:11:01,685
Who are you?

578
01:11:11,987 --> 01:11:15,991
Betty, can I see you
outside for a minute?

579
01:11:29,087 --> 01:11:33,967
- What is it Coco?
- Your aunt called

580
01:11:34,134 --> 01:11:35,426
I was afraid of that.

581
01:11:35,677 --> 01:11:39,598
She wants to know
who's staying in her apartment.

582
01:11:39,996 --> 01:11:42,749
It's just for a night or two,
until she finds her own place.

583
01:11:42,999 --> 01:11:45,252
I tried to explain that to Aunt Ruth,
but the connection was bad...

584
01:11:45,502 --> 01:11:48,337
and her plane was leaving,
and she got it all mixed up.

585
01:11:48,588 --> 01:11:50,590
I kept telling her
it was my friend Rita...

586
01:11:50,841 --> 01:11:54,385
and she kept saying
she didn't know any Ritas...

587
01:11:54,636 --> 01:11:56,513
Look at me straight, sweetie.

588
01:11:56,763 --> 01:11:58,682
Coco... she's very nice.

589
01:11:58,932 --> 01:12:00,517
Honey... you're a good kid.

590
01:12:00,767 --> 01:12:03,937
What you're telling me
is a load of horse-pucky,

591
01:12:04,187 --> 01:12:06,815
even though it comes
from a good place.

592
01:12:07,065 --> 01:12:10,193
Now, I'm gonna trust you
to sort this thing out.

593
01:12:10,443 --> 01:12:13,905
- Thank you.
- Don't make me out to be a sucker.

594
01:12:14,156 --> 01:12:16,283
Louise Bonner says
there's trouble in there.

595
01:12:16,533 --> 01:12:18,285
Remember last night?

596
01:12:18,535 --> 01:12:21,913
Well, sometimes she's wrong,

597
01:12:22,164 --> 01:12:27,418
but if there is trouble
get rid of it.

598
01:12:36,178 --> 01:12:38,096
Is everything all right?

599
01:12:38,345 --> 01:12:40,057
Is it bad for you that I'm here?

600
01:12:40,307 --> 01:12:43,434
No, no, everything is A-okay.

601
01:12:43,685 --> 01:12:45,687
Now, I've gotta fix that sandwich!

602
01:12:45,937 --> 01:12:50,399
And my audition is in one hour.

603
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:11,588
I hope I'm back in a couple of hours.

604
01:13:11,838 --> 01:13:14,758
- Don't drink all the coke.
- Good luck!

605
01:13:15,008 --> 01:13:18,095
When I get back I'll have the cab
waiting, so be ready to go.

606
01:13:18,344 --> 01:13:21,765
- Okay.
- Okay?

607
01:13:49,126 --> 01:13:51,002
Voilà!

608
01:13:51,253 --> 01:13:54,089
Betty Elms,
I'd like you to meet...

609
01:13:54,338 --> 01:13:57,259
Jack Tuptman, my assistant,

610
01:13:57,509 --> 01:13:59,136
Woody Katz who we've
cast in the part...

611
01:13:59,385 --> 01:14:03,389
of "Chuck".
He'll do the scene with you.

612
01:14:03,932 --> 01:14:05,308
Bob Brooker, the director,

613
01:14:05,559 --> 01:14:08,103
and Julie Chadwick...

614
01:14:08,352 --> 01:14:10,647
Now, our surprise guest is:

615
01:14:10,897 --> 01:14:12,941
Linney James.

616
01:14:13,191 --> 01:14:15,277
Alas we can't afford
her to cast our show,

617
01:14:15,527 --> 01:14:18,155
but as casting agents go...

618
01:14:18,404 --> 01:14:20,866
she's the best.

619
01:14:21,116 --> 01:14:23,994
Why thank you, Wally.
Hello Betty.

620
01:14:24,244 --> 01:14:25,954
Very pleased to meet you.

621
01:14:26,204 --> 01:14:29,916
This is my assistant, Nicki.

622
01:14:30,083 --> 01:14:32,252
Oh, and the ever lovely Martha,

623
01:14:32,502 --> 01:14:36,380
Martha Johnson, who
you met out front.

624
01:14:36,673 --> 01:14:38,842
Hi.

625
01:14:39,092 --> 01:14:43,305
So shall we get it to go?

626
01:14:43,555 --> 01:14:47,059
Would you like a water or a coffee
before we begin?

627
01:14:47,308 --> 01:14:49,061
No, no, I'm fine.

628
01:14:49,310 --> 01:14:54,315
Well then, let's everyone take a seat.

629
01:14:56,735 --> 01:15:01,990
Betty, why don't you join Woody over
there and we'll play the scene.

630
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:04,868
Bob, do you have anything
you wish to say...

631
01:15:05,118 --> 01:15:07,996
something to Betty before we begin?

632
01:15:08,246 --> 01:15:12,125
No... it's not a contest,

633
01:15:12,375 --> 01:15:17,839
the two of them with themselves,

634
01:15:18,215 --> 01:15:21,760
so don't play it for real...

635
01:15:22,010 --> 01:15:26,472
until it gets real.

636
01:15:30,185 --> 01:15:32,020
Okay.

637
01:15:32,270 --> 01:15:34,648
Just tell me where it hurts, baby.

638
01:15:34,898 --> 01:15:35,816
What?

639
01:15:36,066 --> 01:15:38,068
Hey Bobby, I want to play
this one nice and close,

640
01:15:38,317 --> 01:15:40,028
like we did with that other girl,

641
01:15:40,278 --> 01:15:42,823
what's her name? The one with the
black hair. That felt kinda good.

642
01:15:43,073 --> 01:15:44,574
- Whaddya think?
- That's good, Woody.

643
01:15:44,825 --> 01:15:47,119
Just don't rush that line again.

644
01:15:47,368 --> 01:15:51,832
I told you... the line where
you say, "Before what?"

645
01:15:52,082 --> 01:15:54,626
Bobby, acting is reacting...

646
01:15:54,876 --> 01:15:58,255
I just play off 'em. They all say:

647
01:15:58,505 --> 01:16:00,215
"They're gonna arrest you" like that...

648
01:16:00,464 --> 01:16:02,341
"put you in jail"...
They all say it the same way,

649
01:16:02,592 --> 01:16:04,803
so I react like that.

650
01:16:05,053 --> 01:16:07,055
- What's your name?
- Betty.

651
01:16:07,305 --> 01:16:11,810
Yeah... Betty, look... You don't rush it.
I don't rush it.

652
01:16:12,060 --> 01:16:14,813
We're gonna play it
nice and close...

653
01:16:15,063 --> 01:16:19,483
just like in the movies. OK?

654
01:16:20,484 --> 01:16:23,989
Dad's best friend goes to work.

655
01:16:28,535 --> 01:16:32,956
And... ACTION!

656
01:16:36,543 --> 01:16:39,970
You're still here?

657
01:16:40,005 --> 01:16:43,424
I came back.
I thought that's what you wanted.

658
01:16:43,675 --> 01:16:46,720
- Nobody wants you here.
- Really?

659
01:16:46,970 --> 01:16:51,141
My parents are right upstairs!
They think you've left.

660
01:16:51,390 --> 01:16:53,476
So... surprise!

661
01:16:53,727 --> 01:16:56,938
I can call them...
I can call my dad...

662
01:16:57,189 --> 01:17:00,275
But you won't...

663
01:17:14,790 --> 01:17:18,877
You're playing a
dangerous game here...

664
01:17:19,086 --> 01:17:21,922
if you're trying to blackmail me...

665
01:17:22,172 --> 01:17:25,675
it's not gonna work.

666
01:17:26,093 --> 01:17:28,344
You know what I want...

667
01:17:28,595 --> 01:17:32,057
it's not that difficult.

668
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:36,686
Get out...

669
01:17:37,270 --> 01:17:40,481
Get out before I call my dad.

670
01:17:40,732 --> 01:17:42,818
He trusts you...

671
01:17:43,068 --> 01:17:45,028
You're...

672
01:17:45,278 --> 01:17:48,406
his best friend.

673
01:17:51,159 --> 01:17:55,122
This will be the end of everything.

674
01:17:56,289 --> 01:18:00,210
What about you?
What will your dad think about you?

675
01:18:00,459 --> 01:18:02,921
Stop...

676
01:18:03,171 --> 01:18:06,258
stop it!

677
01:18:06,633 --> 01:18:10,095
That's what you said
from the beginning.

678
01:18:10,887 --> 01:18:13,223
If I tell them what happened...
they'll arrest you...

679
01:18:13,472 --> 01:18:16,893
and put you in jail,

680
01:18:22,524 --> 01:18:24,526
so get out of here...

681
01:18:24,776 --> 01:18:27,696
before...

682
01:18:29,823 --> 01:18:32,951
Before what?

683
01:18:50,135 --> 01:18:52,512
Before...

684
01:18:52,763 --> 01:18:56,266
I kill you.

685
01:19:10,030 --> 01:19:13,533
Then they'd put you in jail.

686
01:19:21,374 --> 01:19:24,418
I hate you...

687
01:19:24,878 --> 01:19:28,298
I hate us both!

688
01:19:42,521 --> 01:19:47,067
- I'm going to take her over there.
- Yeah big time!

689
01:19:49,778 --> 01:19:52,446
Wow! Well, there it was.

690
01:19:52,698 --> 01:19:54,908
There it was all right!

691
01:19:55,158 --> 01:19:59,495
Baby, you got away with it!

692
01:20:01,665 --> 01:20:04,375
Very good. Really.

693
01:20:04,626 --> 01:20:07,087
I mean it was forced maybe...

694
01:20:07,336 --> 01:20:11,174
but still humanistic.

695
01:20:11,424 --> 01:20:12,175
Yeah,

696
01:20:12,425 --> 01:20:14,177
very good,

697
01:20:14,427 --> 01:20:18,515
really.

698
01:20:23,270 --> 01:20:25,731
Oh I thank you Betty...

699
01:20:25,981 --> 01:20:28,441
and I really mean that sincerely.

700
01:20:28,692 --> 01:20:32,696
I mean, it was extraordinary.

701
01:20:32,946 --> 01:20:34,447
You've done your Aunt proud...

702
01:20:34,698 --> 01:20:38,660
and I'm going to tell her
the first chance I get.

703
01:20:38,910 --> 01:20:41,163
Now, you and I...

704
01:20:41,412 --> 01:20:43,165
are gonna speak again soon.

705
01:20:43,414 --> 01:20:45,542
Thank you Mr. Brown.

706
01:20:45,792 --> 01:20:47,544
Thank you, Wally.

707
01:20:47,794 --> 01:20:50,922
I'm sure you all have a lot to
talk about. We'll walk Betty out.

708
01:20:51,173 --> 01:20:54,926
Well, yes indeed.
And it was our pleasure, Linney.

709
01:20:55,177 --> 01:20:57,554
Don't you be a stranger around here.

710
01:20:57,804 --> 01:21:00,724
- We'd love to have you here.
- Come on, Betty.

711
01:21:00,974 --> 01:21:02,559
Thank you again, Mr. Brown.

712
01:21:02,809 --> 01:21:07,189
It was nice meeting all of you.

713
01:21:13,570 --> 01:21:16,322
Wow!

714
01:21:16,573 --> 01:21:18,324
How do you find her...

715
01:21:18,575 --> 01:21:22,037
God, that was awful!

716
01:21:22,287 --> 01:21:24,706
Not you Betty.
You were stellar and I mean that.

717
01:21:24,956 --> 01:21:26,583
But poor Wally.

718
01:21:26,833 --> 01:21:28,752
- He'll never get that picture made.
- Why?

719
01:21:29,002 --> 01:21:31,129
Wally's days were up 20 years ago.

720
01:21:31,379 --> 01:21:34,340
You know Woody Katz
is only doing it for a favor?

721
01:21:34,591 --> 01:21:36,551
And the cast is terrible...

722
01:21:36,802 --> 01:21:38,678
Oh, God, terrible.

723
01:21:38,929 --> 01:21:41,056
Poor old fool Wally...

724
01:21:41,306 --> 01:21:45,060
It was very nice
and he seems so sweet.

725
01:21:45,310 --> 01:21:48,105
...and Wally... Mr. Brown... is a
very close friend of my Aunt's, so...

726
01:21:48,354 --> 01:21:51,108
Settle down, Betty.
Don't get me wrong. I love Wally.

727
01:21:51,357 --> 01:21:54,820
I ought to. I was married
to him for ten years.

728
01:21:55,070 --> 01:21:57,906
And I love actors, all actors.

729
01:21:58,156 --> 01:22:01,243
We just get a little catty sometimes.

730
01:22:01,492 --> 01:22:03,995
Now we want to take you across
and introduce you to a director...

731
01:22:04,246 --> 01:22:05,914
who's a head above the rest.

732
01:22:06,164 --> 01:22:08,959
He's got a project
that you would kill!

733
01:22:09,209 --> 01:22:12,713
Knock it right out of the park.

734
01:24:04,866 --> 01:24:07,619
Cut it! Thank you very
much, Carol. I'm coming back.

735
01:24:07,869 --> 01:24:10,080
Checking the gate?
Checking the gate!

736
01:24:10,329 --> 01:24:12,082
Thank you!
Will tell you what happens next!

737
01:24:12,331 --> 01:24:15,376
Thank you very much, for coming in
I know how busy you are.

738
01:24:15,627 --> 01:24:18,505
Oh, are you kidding me? I love
this script! Show me where to sign!

739
01:24:18,755 --> 01:24:20,507
Look... I love you...

740
01:24:20,757 --> 01:24:23,260
but there's no way they're gonna let me
cast this thing until I've seen everyone.

741
01:24:23,510 --> 01:24:25,262
- I'll let you know as soon as I can.
- I know you will.

742
01:24:25,512 --> 01:24:29,390
Cause my manager's gonna be bugging
you day and night... and me.

743
01:24:29,641 --> 01:24:31,727
- It'll be my pleasure. Now, get out of here.
- Oh, you're just so cruel to me...

744
01:24:31,977 --> 01:24:34,104
don't forget me. I'm the girl
that's going to play this part.

745
01:24:34,353 --> 01:24:37,607
See ya later.

746
01:24:37,858 --> 01:24:39,901
Hank... where's Hank?

747
01:24:40,152 --> 01:24:43,864
- Who's next, Hank?
- Camilla Rhodes.

748
01:24:43,947 --> 01:24:47,034
- Is she ready?
- Already.

749
01:24:47,284 --> 01:24:51,204
- Bring her in.
- Camilla Rhodes next.

750
01:24:56,043 --> 01:25:00,839
Sylvia North's story,
Camilla Rhodes, take one.

751
01:25:00,964 --> 01:25:03,592
Ok, here we go...
Let's lock it up, please!

752
01:25:03,842 --> 01:25:06,094
- Roll sound please...
- That's it!

753
01:25:06,343 --> 01:25:09,806
Playback!
ACTION!

754
01:25:40,003 --> 01:25:41,880
Get Jason over here.

755
01:25:42,130 --> 01:25:46,176
Cindy... Adam wants to see Jason.

756
01:26:24,176 --> 01:26:26,676
Did you want
to tell me something, Adam?

757
01:26:37,476 --> 01:26:40,981
This is the girl!

758
01:26:44,568 --> 01:26:49,156
Excellent choice, Adam.

759
01:26:58,330 --> 01:27:01,459
Oh... my goodness.

760
01:27:09,801 --> 01:27:11,928
I have to be somewhere.

761
01:27:12,179 --> 01:27:15,265
I promised a friend.

762
01:27:15,515 --> 01:27:19,186
I'm sorry. I must go...

763
01:27:43,417 --> 01:27:45,962
It should be around here...

764
01:27:46,213 --> 01:27:48,548
2590... That's it.

765
01:27:48,799 --> 01:27:50,300
Up there!

766
01:27:50,550 --> 01:27:53,013
- Does it look familiar?
- No.

767
01:28:00,852 --> 01:28:03,146
- Don't stop!
- What is it? What do you see?!

768
01:28:03,396 --> 01:28:07,734
- Those men in front, in the car.
- Do you know them?!

769
01:28:07,984 --> 01:28:09,152
- No... but...
- Keep going.

770
01:28:09,402 --> 01:28:12,823
Go around to the back.

771
01:29:00,537 --> 01:29:03,999
Selwyn... number 12.

772
01:29:26,271 --> 01:29:29,691
Now, you've got me scared.

773
01:29:53,256 --> 01:29:58,053
See, I told you there was nothing
to be afraid of!

774
01:30:59,990 --> 01:31:02,408
Betty wait... wait.

775
01:31:03,535 --> 01:31:06,454
Oh no... don't.

776
01:31:30,937 --> 01:31:32,522
No one's home.

777
01:31:32,773 --> 01:31:36,068
Yes?

778
01:31:40,781 --> 01:31:44,618
Number 17.

779
01:31:44,659 --> 01:31:47,829
But it said number 12.

780
01:31:48,955 --> 01:31:52,834
I switched apartments with her.
She's in 17.

781
01:31:53,085 --> 01:31:56,420
It's down in the end on the left.

782
01:31:59,966 --> 01:32:03,720
She hasn't been around
for a few days...

783
01:32:05,263 --> 01:32:09,184
- Oh... we'll leave her a note.
- I'll go with you.

784
01:32:11,186 --> 01:32:14,648
She's still got some of my stuff.

785
01:32:19,069 --> 01:32:22,656
You go ahead.
I've got to get that.

786
01:32:36,962 --> 01:32:39,089
I guess you're not Diane Selwyn.

787
01:32:39,338 --> 01:32:42,801
Guess I'm not.

788
01:33:18,295 --> 01:33:21,798
Still no one's home I guess.

789
01:33:50,035 --> 01:33:51,494
- What are you doing?
- C'mon!

790
01:33:51,745 --> 01:33:54,455
C'mon help me in. Come on.

791
01:33:54,706 --> 01:33:58,126
I'll open the front door.

792
01:34:03,715 --> 01:34:06,802
C'mon.

793
01:36:37,160 --> 01:36:40,580
I know what you're doing.

794
01:37:00,349 --> 01:37:03,770
I know what you have to do,

795
01:37:05,396 --> 01:37:08,859
but let me do it.

796
01:37:16,407 --> 01:37:19,870
Let me do it.

797
01:37:41,933 --> 01:37:45,436
You look like someone else.

798
01:38:06,124 --> 01:38:08,376
Good night, Betty.

799
01:38:08,627 --> 01:38:10,419
You don't wear it in the house.

800
01:38:10,670 --> 01:38:12,547
What?

801
01:38:12,798 --> 01:38:15,550
The wig.

802
01:38:15,801 --> 01:38:18,929
Just I'm looking
at myself again...

803
01:38:19,179 --> 01:38:20,889
I'll take it off to sleep.

804
01:38:21,139 --> 01:38:23,349
And you don't have
to sleep on that couch.

805
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:25,602
No, it's okay.

806
01:38:25,852 --> 01:38:28,772
No it's not. This is a huge bed.

807
01:38:29,022 --> 01:38:32,567
C'mon, just get in and
get a good night sleep.

808
01:39:03,389 --> 01:39:07,060
It's more comfortable
than the couch, isn't it?

809
01:39:07,310 --> 01:39:10,147
Yes.

810
01:39:16,028 --> 01:39:18,822
Thank you, Betty.

811
01:39:18,864 --> 01:39:20,866
It's nothing.

812
01:39:21,116 --> 01:39:23,243
I shouldn't have let you sleep
on the couch last night.

813
01:39:23,492 --> 01:39:26,038
No... I mean...

814
01:39:26,288 --> 01:39:30,667
Thank you for everything.

815
01:39:32,502 --> 01:39:35,922
You're welcome.

816
01:39:44,598 --> 01:39:48,060
Good night, sweet Betty.

817
01:39:56,610 --> 01:39:59,738
Good night.

818
01:40:40,444 --> 01:40:44,241
Have you ever done this before?

819
01:40:44,783 --> 01:40:46,702
I don't know!

820
01:40:46,952 --> 01:40:50,080
Have you?

821
01:41:02,425 --> 01:41:06,221
I want to with you...

822
01:41:31,079 --> 01:41:34,791
I'm in love with you.

823
01:41:48,180 --> 01:41:51,892
I'm in love with you.

824
01:42:17,584 --> 01:42:20,419
Silencio.

825
01:42:21,379 --> 01:42:24,174
Silencio.

826
01:42:24,674 --> 01:42:27,636
Silencio.

827
01:42:28,553 --> 01:42:31,681
No hay banda.

828
01:42:32,265 --> 01:42:35,519
No hay banda.

829
01:42:35,560 --> 01:42:38,814
No hay orquestra.

830
01:42:39,815 --> 01:42:49,282
Silencio.

831
01:42:50,242 --> 01:42:53,078
Silencio.

832
01:42:53,912 --> 01:42:56,748
Silencio.

833
01:42:57,708 --> 01:43:00,168
- Rita?
- No hay banda.

834
01:43:00,418 --> 01:43:03,505
Rita, wake up.

835
01:43:04,798 --> 01:43:08,510
- No, no...
- It's ok, it's ok.

836
01:43:08,760 --> 01:43:11,513
No it's not ok.

837
01:43:11,763 --> 01:43:14,641
What's wrong?

838
01:43:14,891 --> 01:43:18,352
Go with me somewhere...

839
01:43:19,187 --> 01:43:24,651
It's 2 o'clock.
It's 2 o'clock in the morning.

840
01:43:26,069 --> 01:43:29,239
Go with me somewhere...

841
01:43:29,488 --> 01:43:33,578
Sure. Now?

842
01:43:34,786 --> 01:43:36,999
Right now!

843
01:45:11,174 --> 01:45:14,553
No hay banda!

844
01:45:14,803 --> 01:45:18,306
There is no band!

845
01:45:18,557 --> 01:45:22,476
Il n'est pas de orquestra!

846
01:45:22,728 --> 01:45:25,313
This is all...

847
01:45:25,564 --> 01:45:28,233
a tape-recording.

848
01:45:28,482 --> 01:45:29,483
No hay banda!

849
01:45:29,735 --> 01:45:34,906
And yet we hear a band.

850
01:45:35,032 --> 01:45:38,451
If we want to hear a clarinette...

851
01:45:38,702 --> 01:45:41,204
listen...

852
01:45:46,626 --> 01:45:51,923
Un trombon "à coulisse".

853
01:45:54,551 --> 01:45:58,597
Un trombon "con sordina".

854
01:45:58,722 --> 01:46:05,687
Sient le son du trombon in sourdine.

855
01:46:08,315 --> 01:46:11,109
Hear le son...

856
01:46:11,318 --> 01:46:16,281
and mute it... drop it...

857
01:46:32,798 --> 01:46:36,968
It's all recorded.

858
01:46:38,178 --> 01:46:42,599
No hay banda!

859
01:46:42,641 --> 01:46:47,562
It's all a tape.

860
01:46:56,697 --> 01:46:59,533
Il n'est pas de orquestra.

861
01:46:59,783 --> 01:47:02,077
It is...

862
01:47:02,327 --> 01:47:05,872
an illusion.

863
01:47:09,042 --> 01:47:12,003
Listen...

864
01:48:25,160 --> 01:48:27,411
Senoras y senores...

865
01:48:27,662 --> 01:48:33,794
el club Silencio les presenta
la llorona de Los Angeles:

866
01:48:34,044 --> 01:48:38,464
Rebekah del Rio.

867
01:53:17,577 --> 01:53:20,038
Betty?

868
01:53:22,456 --> 01:53:24,835
Betty?

869
01:53:36,304 --> 01:53:39,933
Donde estas?

870
01:53:52,029 --> 01:53:54,488
Betty?

871
01:56:21,928 --> 01:56:25,057
Hey, pretty little girl...

872
01:56:25,307 --> 01:56:28,769
time to wake up.

873
01:58:04,197 --> 01:58:07,701
- Where have you been?
- What do you want?

874
01:58:07,951 --> 01:58:11,538
My lamp and dishes...

875
01:58:12,664 --> 01:58:16,543
C'mon Diane, it's been 3 weeks.

876
01:58:18,003 --> 01:58:21,715
I put your dishes in that box.

877
01:58:40,984 --> 01:58:45,197
- That's my ashtray.
- Take it.

878
01:58:56,415 --> 01:58:57,375
Anytime...

879
01:58:57,626 --> 01:59:01,755
I'm just making sure, Diane.

880
01:59:10,055 --> 01:59:13,809
- This is it?
- Yeah.

881
01:59:17,896 --> 01:59:22,693
Ah, by the way, those two detectives
came by again, looking for you.

882
02:00:14,870 --> 02:00:17,539
Camilla!

883
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:23,128
You've come back!

884
02:02:03,812 --> 02:02:07,107
What was that you
were saying, beautiful?

885
02:02:07,356 --> 02:02:09,483
I said:

886
02:02:09,735 --> 02:02:13,196
"You drive me wild".

887
02:02:24,916 --> 02:02:28,377
We shouldn't do this anymore...

888
02:02:33,759 --> 02:02:36,887
Don't say that...

889
02:02:40,932 --> 02:02:43,643
Don't ever say that!

890
02:02:43,894 --> 02:02:45,812
Don't Diane,

891
02:02:46,063 --> 02:02:49,941
Stop it...
Diane STOP!

892
02:02:50,192 --> 02:02:54,112
I've tried to tell you this before.

893
02:03:01,787 --> 02:03:05,540
It's him, isn't it?

894
02:03:15,466 --> 02:03:17,636
I'm not trying to show
you how to do the scene.

895
02:03:17,886 --> 02:03:20,305
Just watch me...

896
02:03:20,555 --> 02:03:24,184
and I think you'll understand
what I'm getting at.

897
02:03:27,562 --> 02:03:29,731
Don't seat so rigid...

898
02:03:29,981 --> 02:03:33,235
just, just relax...

899
02:03:33,484 --> 02:03:35,361
The two of you are alone...

900
02:03:35,612 --> 02:03:39,199
and it's real comfortable...

901
02:03:39,324 --> 02:03:41,910
like you've known
each other forever...

902
02:03:42,160 --> 02:03:46,372
even if you don't say anything...
It's real comfortable.

903
02:03:47,249 --> 02:03:49,000
Hank, can you just clear the set...

904
02:03:49,251 --> 02:03:51,753
there's too many people around here...
Let's get this worked out...

905
02:03:52,003 --> 02:03:54,339
Clear the set! Clear the set!

906
02:03:54,589 --> 02:03:57,300
Everyone get a cup of coffee.

907
02:03:57,551 --> 02:04:00,721
- Everyone please!
- Can Diane stay?

908
02:04:00,971 --> 02:04:07,019
Yes, true. Diane can stay.
Hank, let Diane stay.

909
02:04:11,857 --> 02:04:13,608
Now when she starts to cry...

910
02:04:13,859 --> 02:04:17,320
don't pull her toward you.

911
02:04:17,529 --> 02:04:20,532
Let her fall in to you...

912
02:04:20,782 --> 02:04:24,244
Let her fall.

913
02:04:26,246 --> 02:04:29,708
When you kiss her...

914
02:04:29,875 --> 02:04:34,212
It's just a continuation of that move.

915
02:04:34,963 --> 02:04:38,008
There is no break...

916
02:05:02,532 --> 02:05:05,619
Kill the lights!

917
02:05:14,418 --> 02:05:15,670
Don't be mad!

918
02:05:15,921 --> 02:05:19,091
- Don't make it be like this!
- Oh, sure.

919
02:05:19,341 --> 02:05:21,885
You want me to make
this easy for you? No!

920
02:05:22,135 --> 02:05:25,222
No-fucking-way it's not gonna be!

921
02:05:25,471 --> 02:05:29,475
It's not easy for me!

922
02:06:52,184 --> 02:06:53,769
Hello, it's me...

923
02:06:54,019 --> 02:06:57,105
leave a message...

924
02:07:04,654 --> 02:07:07,574
Hello?

925
02:07:10,702 --> 02:07:13,246
Diane, the car is waiting.

926
02:07:13,496 --> 02:07:15,290
Are you ok?

927
02:07:15,540 --> 02:07:18,668
You comin'?

928
02:07:23,256 --> 02:07:24,925
Good...

929
02:07:25,175 --> 02:07:28,095
It means so much to me.

930
02:07:28,345 --> 02:07:31,932
Go on... the car is
right outside the house..

931
02:07:32,182 --> 02:07:35,602
It's been waiting, ok?

932
02:07:39,231 --> 02:07:40,941
Ok.

933
02:07:41,191 --> 02:07:45,946
It's 6980, Mulholland Drive.

934
02:07:46,196 --> 02:07:49,616
Mulholland Drive.

935
02:08:57,893 --> 02:09:02,564
What are you doing?
We don't stop here...

936
02:09:05,817 --> 02:09:09,696
A surprise...

937
02:09:30,967 --> 02:09:34,387
Shortcut.

938
02:09:34,971 --> 02:09:38,058
C'mon sweetheart.

939
02:09:43,021 --> 02:09:44,981
It's beautiful.

940
02:09:45,232 --> 02:09:48,694
A secret path.

941
02:10:55,384 --> 02:10:57,888
Ah, perfect timing!

942
02:10:58,305 --> 02:11:01,474
Welcome, Diane.

943
02:11:06,146 --> 02:11:08,190
Well...

944
02:11:08,439 --> 02:11:12,027
Here's to love...

945
02:11:20,160 --> 02:11:22,954
Here's to love...

946
02:11:26,917 --> 02:11:30,253
Ah, here she is...

947
02:11:38,303 --> 02:11:41,848
I don't believe
you met my mother...

948
02:11:41,973 --> 02:11:44,226
Hi, I'm Diane Selwyn.

949
02:11:44,475 --> 02:11:47,020
Just call me Coco,
everybody does...

950
02:11:47,270 --> 02:11:49,397
- Pleased to meet you...
- Let's eat...

951
02:11:49,648 --> 02:11:52,776
I'm starving...

952
02:11:57,948 --> 02:12:01,576
I'm sorry, I was late.

953
02:12:20,428 --> 02:12:23,472
I'm from Deep River, Ontario...

954
02:12:23,724 --> 02:12:25,474
a small town.

955
02:12:25,726 --> 02:12:30,105
So, you rolled in here from Canada.

956
02:12:30,354 --> 02:12:33,817
I've always wanted to come here.

957
02:12:34,026 --> 02:12:37,486
I won this jitterbug contest...

958
02:12:37,738 --> 02:12:41,116
that sort of led to acting...

959
02:12:41,533 --> 02:12:45,453
you know, wanting to act.

960
02:12:45,620 --> 02:12:49,082
When my aunt died...

961
02:12:49,332 --> 02:12:53,795
anyway, she left me so money...
she worked here...

962
02:12:54,046 --> 02:12:56,631
In the movies?

963
02:12:56,882 --> 02:12:59,217
Yes.

964
02:12:59,467 --> 02:13:03,471
How did you meet Camilla?

965
02:13:03,722 --> 02:13:05,807
On a "Sylvia North Story".

966
02:13:06,058 --> 02:13:09,477
Camilla was great in that.

967
02:13:23,241 --> 02:13:27,329
Yeah, I wanted the lead so bad.

968
02:13:27,579 --> 02:13:31,583
Anyway, Camilla got the part.

969
02:13:33,502 --> 02:13:35,879
The director...

970
02:13:36,129 --> 02:13:38,215
Bob Brooker?

971
02:13:38,464 --> 02:13:41,343
Yes.

972
02:13:42,636 --> 02:13:46,098
He didn't think so much of me...

973
02:13:49,768 --> 02:13:53,605
anyway, that's when
we became friends.

974
02:13:53,855 --> 02:13:55,607
She helped me...

975
02:13:55,857 --> 02:14:00,904
getting some parts
in some of her films.

976
02:14:01,697 --> 02:14:04,407
I see.

977
02:14:17,963 --> 02:14:20,549
So, I got the pool...

978
02:14:20,799 --> 02:14:24,344
and she got the pool-man.

979
02:14:25,012 --> 02:14:30,600
I couldn't believe it. I wanted
to buy that judge a Rolls-Royce.

980
02:14:35,981 --> 02:14:39,442
Sometimes good things happen.

981
02:15:32,037 --> 02:15:35,832
So, I guess we saved
the best for last...

982
02:15:37,834 --> 02:15:39,086
Do you want to tell them?

983
02:15:39,336 --> 02:15:42,756
No, you to tell them.

984
02:15:45,509 --> 02:15:48,929
Camilla and I...

985
02:16:00,065 --> 02:16:03,484
are going to be...

986
02:16:13,912 --> 02:16:16,998
Sorry about that.

987
02:16:24,089 --> 02:16:27,175
No, I'm fine.

988
02:16:31,763 --> 02:16:35,350
This is the girl.

989
02:16:35,600 --> 02:16:38,937
Don't show me
this photo-thing here.

990
02:16:39,187 --> 02:16:43,650
It's just an actress' photo,
everybody's got one.

991
02:16:43,900 --> 02:16:46,360
You got the money?

992
02:16:46,611 --> 02:16:49,740
Sure do.

993
02:16:59,750 --> 02:17:05,379
Ok, once you hand that over
to me, it's a done deal.

994
02:17:06,798 --> 02:17:11,094
Are you sure you want this?

995
02:17:14,514 --> 02:17:18,143
More than anything in this world.

996
02:17:27,986 --> 02:17:31,489
When it's finished, you'll find
this where I told you.

997
02:17:44,712 --> 02:17:48,048
What's it open?

998
02:22:12,411 --> 02:22:15,602
Silencio.
